# ✅ Auto-Login & Match Improvements - October 21, 2025

## Overview

Fixed 3 critical UX issues in the iOS app:
1. ✅ Enhanced matched lead details (now shows full info)
2. ✅ Added "Not a Good Fit" dismiss feature for leads
3. ✅ Implemented auto-login (keeps users logged in indefinitely)

---

## 1. ✅ Enhanced Matched Lead Details

### Problem:
Users couldn't see important information about matched leads in the property matches view.

### Solution:
Added comprehensive lead information display when expanded:

**Now Shows:**
- ✅ **Contact Info:** Email and phone (if available)
- ✅ **Budget:** Lead's budget requirements
- ✅ **Size Needs:** Min-max square footage range
- ✅ **Timeline:** When they need the space (Immediate, Heating Up, etc.)
- ✅ **Lead Status:** Cold, Warm, Hot, or Closed
- ✅ **Match Reasons:** Why this lead matches (already there)

**Visual Improvements:**
- Color-coded icons for each data type
- Status indicator with appropriate colors
- Timeline urgency colors (red for Immediate, orange for Heating Up)
- Clear "Lead Requirements" section header
- Professional formatting with proper spacing

### Example Display:
```
Contact:
📧 john@example.com
📱 (561) 555-1234

LEAD REQUIREMENTS:
💰 Budget: $5,000 - $10,000/mo
📏 Size: 5,000 - 10,000 SF
⏰ Timeline: Immediate
🔥 Status: Hot
```

## 2. ✅ Lead Dismiss Feature ("Not a Good Fit")

### Problem:
No way to dismiss leads that aren't actually a good fit for a property, even if algorithm matched them.

### Solution:
Added intelligent dismiss system with full UX flow:

**New "Not a Good Fit" Button:**
- Located below "View Details" and "Send Property" buttons
- Gray styling (non-destructive action)
- Icon: xmark.circle
- Dismisses lead from this property's matches

**Dismiss Behavior:**
- ✅ Lead removed from visible matches (animated)
- ✅ Haptic feedback on dismiss (success notification)
- ✅ Counter updates ("3 Matching Leads" → "2 Matching Leads")
- ✅ Shows dismissed count ("1 lead dismissed as not a good fit")
- ✅ Session-based (dismissed state per property view)

**After All Dismissed:**
When all matched leads are dismissed, shows:
```
✅ All leads reviewed

You've dismissed all matched leads for this property

[Show Dismissed Leads] button
```

**Undo Capability:**
- Tap "Show Dismissed Leads" to bring them all back
- Re-evaluate if you change your mind
- No permanent data loss

### Why This Matters:
- Gives users control over match relevance
- Algorithm isn't perfect - human override needed
- Reduces noise in match results
- Improves workflow efficiency

## 3. ✅ Auto-Login Implementation (Stay Logged In)

### Problem:
App was logging users out after 1 hour (token expiration), requiring re-login.

### Solution:
Implemented automatic token refresh system - users now stay logged in indefinitely!

**How It Works:**

**Before (Old Behavior):**
```swift
if keychain.isTokenExpired() {
    logout() // ❌ Force re-login
    throw NetworkError.unauthorized
}
```

**After (New Behavior):**
```swift
if keychain.isTokenExpired() {
    try await refreshToken() // ✅ Auto-refresh
    // User stays logged in!
}
```

**Token Refresh Flow:**
1. Token expires after ~1 hour
2. Next API call detects expiration
3. Automatically calls Netlify Identity refresh endpoint
4. Gets new access token (valid for another hour)
5. Saves new token to keychain
6. User never notices - stays logged in!

**Implementation Details:**
```swift
private func refreshToken() async throws {
    guard let refreshToken = keychain.get(.refreshToken) else {
        throw NetworkError.unauthorized
    }
    
    // Call Netlify Identity token endpoint
    let url = URL(string: "https://trusenda.com/.netlify/identity/token")
    
    // POST with grant_type=refresh_token
    let bodyString = "grant_type=refresh_token&refresh_token=\(refreshToken)"
    
    // Get new tokens
    let tokenResponse = try JSONDecoder().decode(AuthToken.self, from: data)
    
    // Save to keychain
    keychain.saveTokens(
        accessToken: tokenResponse.accessToken,
        refreshToken: tokenResponse.refreshToken ?? refreshToken,
        expiresIn: tokenResponse.expiresIn
    )
}
```

**Matches Cloud App:**
- ✅ Cloud uses netlify-identity-widget (auto-refreshes)
- ✅ iOS now has same seamless experience
- ✅ Users stay logged in until explicit logout
- ✅ No interruptions during work

**Security:**
- Still secure - uses Netlify's refresh token mechanism
- Refresh tokens can be revoked server-side if needed
- Only happens when token actually expires
- Fails gracefully if refresh token invalid

## 4. ✅ Cloud Photo Zoom (Deployed)

### Also Fixed in Cloud App:
Added fullscreen photo zoom to property pages (trusenda.com)

**Features:**
- Click property photo to expand fullscreen
- Zoom with +/− buttons, scroll wheel, or click
- Pan when zoomed in (drag)
- Navigate multiple photos with arrows
- Professional lightbox UI

**Status:** ✅ Deployed to production
