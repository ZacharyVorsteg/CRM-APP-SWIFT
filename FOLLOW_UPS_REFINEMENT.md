# Follow-Ups Tab Refinement - Salesforce CRM Language

## ✅ Changes Applied

Based on your feedback, I've made the Follow-Ups screen more professional and functional.

**Date:** October 19, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

---

## 🎯 Issues Fixed

### 1. Redundant Date Display ✅
**Before:** "Tomorrow Tomorrow" (duplicate)  
**After:** 
```
Tomorrow          (bold, primary)
Oct 20, 2025      (caption, secondary)
```

**Fix:** Removed duplicate relative date, now shows relative + full date for clarity

### 2. Generic "Created" Label ✅
**Before:** "CREATED" (too vague)  
**After:** "ADDED TO CRM" (Salesforce-style, specific)

**Also changed icon:**
- Before: `calendar`
- After: `calendar.badge.plus` (more meaningful)

### 3. Unclear Snooze Options ✅
**Before:** "1 Day", "3 Days", "1 Week" (ambiguous)  
**After:** "Add 1 day", "Add 3 days", "Add 1 week" (clear action)

**Icon changed:**
- Before: `clock`
- After: `plus.circle` (indicates adding time)

### 4. No Way to Edit Task ✅
**Before:** Couldn't edit task notes from Follow-Ups screen  
**After:** New "Edit Task" button opens modal

**Features:**
- Edit task notes inline
- Shows lead name and company
- Shows current due date
- Save updates instantly
- Haptic feedback

## 🎨 New UI Elements

### Edit Task Button
**Location:** Between "Contacted" and "Snooze"  
**Style:** Bordered button, blue  
**Icon:** Pencil circle  
**Action:** Opens edit modal

### Edit Task Modal
**Header:**
- "Edit Task for"
- Lead name (bold)
- Company (if exists)
- Due date with relative format

**Content:**
- Task Details section
- TextEditor with placeholder
- Full-width "Update Task" button

**UX:**
- Pre-filled with current task

## 🎯 Salesforce CRM Language

### Professional Terminology:
- ✅ "Added to CRM" (not "Created")
- ✅ "Add 1 day" (clear action)
- ✅ "Edit Task" (clear intent)
- ✅ "Task Details" (professional)
- ✅ "Update Task" (not just "Save")

### Matches Enterprise CRM Standards:
- Salesforce uses "Created Date" or "Date Added"
- HubSpot uses "Create Date"
- Microsoft Dynamics uses "Created On"
- **We use:** "Added to CRM" (clear and specific) ✅
