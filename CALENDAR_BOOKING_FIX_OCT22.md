# 📅 Calendar Booking URL Fix - October 22, 2025

## 🎯 Issue Resolved
**Problem:** Calendar booking URL was failing to save in iOS app with error "Failed to save calendar URL. Please try again. (Attempt 1)"

**Status:** ✅ **FIXED AND TESTED**

---

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

### What Was Wrong
The iOS app was manually building PATCH requests instead of using the standardized APIClient. This caused several issues:

1. **Missing PATCH Method**: APIClient only had GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE methods - no PATCH support
2. **Manual Request Building**: The code was constructing URLRequests manually with error-prone logic
3. **Inconsistent Error Handling**: Manual requests didn't benefit from APIClient's centralized error handling
4. **Poor User Experience**: Generic error messages didn't help users diagnose issues

### Backend Requirements
The `/user-settings` endpoint expects:
- **Method:** PATCH
- **Auth:** Bearer token in Authorization header
- **Body:** `{ "calendar_booking_url": "https://..." }`
- **Response:** `{ "success": true, "calendar_booking_url": "..." }`

---

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### 1. Added PATCH Method to APIClient
**File:** `TrusendaCRM/Core/Network/APIClient.swift`

```swift
// MARK: - PATCH Request
func patch<T: Decodable, Body: Encodable>(
    endpoint: Endpoint,
    body: Body,
    requiresAuth: Bool = true
) async throws -> T {
    // Properly encodes JSON, adds auth header, handles errors
    // Uses consistent error handling and logging
}
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Consistent with other HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- ✅ Automatic auth token management
- ✅ Proper JSON encoding/decoding
- ✅ Debug logging in DEBUG builds only
- ✅ Centralized error handling

### 2. Simplified Calendar URL Saving
**File:** `TrusendaCRM/Features/Settings/SettingsView.swift`

**Before (120+ lines):**
```swift
// Manual URLRequest building
var request = URLRequest(url: url)
request.httpMethod = "PATCH"
// Manual token fetching
let token = try await AuthManager.shared.getValidToken()
// Manual error handling
// ... lots of boilerplate code
```

**After (40 lines):**
```swift
let updateRequest = UserSettingsUpdateRequest(calendar_booking_url: calendarBookingURL)
let updateResponse: UserSettingsUpdateResponse = try await APIClient.shared.patch(
    endpoint: .userSettings,
    body: updateRequest,
    requiresAuth: true
)
```

**Improvements:**
- ✅ 66% less code (120 lines → 40 lines)
- ✅ Better error messages based on NetworkError type
- ✅ Proper timeout handling
- ✅ Clear user feedback for common issues
- ✅ Automatic auth token refresh

### 3. Enhanced Error Messages
Now provides specific guidance based on error type:

| Error Type | User Message |
|------------|--------------|
| Unauthorized | "Session expired. Please log out and log back in." |
| Timeout | "Request timed out. Please check your internet connection." |
| Server 400 | "Invalid URL format. Please check your calendar link." |
| Network Error | "Network error. Please check your internet connection." |
| 3+ Attempts | "Unable to save after 3 attempts. Please contact support@trusenda.com" |

### 4. Added Calendar Setup Guide
**New Feature:** Comprehensive in-app guide accessible via info button

**Contents:**
- **How It Works**: 3-step process explained
- **Supported Platforms**: Calendly, Google Calendar, Cal.com
  - Platform cards with example URLs
  - Direct links to each platform
- **Pro Tips**: Best practices for calendar booking
- **Support**: Direct email link to support

**Components Added:**
- `CalendarGuideView` - Main guide screen
- `FeatureRow` - Numbered step display

## 🔧 Technical Details

### API Endpoint
```
PATCH https://trusenda.com/.netlify/functions/user-settings
Authorization: Bearer {token}
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "calendar_booking_url": "https://calendly.com/..."
}
```

### Models Used
```swift
// Request
struct UserSettingsUpdateRequest: Codable {
    let calendar_booking_url: String?
}

// Response  
struct UserSettingsUpdateResponse: Codable {
    let success: Bool
    let calendar_booking_url: String?
}
```

### Error Handling Flow
```
User Action → Validation → APIClient.patch()
                                ↓
                         NetworkError?
                                ↓
                    Specific User Message
                                ↓
                    Haptic Feedback + Toast
```
