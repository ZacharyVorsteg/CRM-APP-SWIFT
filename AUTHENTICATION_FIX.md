# âœ… Authentication Fixed - Works with Netlify Identity

## What Was Fixed:

1. âœ… **Login endpoint**: Now uses correct Netlify Identity token API
   - Endpoint: `POST https://trusenda.com/.netlify/identity/token`
   - Payload: `{ "grant_type": "password", "username": email, "password": password }`
   - Matches web app's netlify-identity-widget behavior

2. âœ… **Info.plist**: Removed SceneDelegate configuration
   - No more "SceneDelegate not found" warnings
   - Uses SwiftUI app lifecycle (same as modern iOS apps)

3. âœ… **Constraint warnings**: Suppressed harmless keyboard layout warnings
   - These don't affect functionality

## How It Works Now:

### iOS App:
1. User enters email/password on login screen
2. App calls `POST /.netlify/identity/token` with credentials
3. Receives JWT access token (same format as web app)
4. Stores token in Keychain (iOS) vs localStorage (web)
5. Calls `/me` endpoint to get user data
6. Shows main CRM interface

### Web App (React):
1. User clicks "Sign In" button
2. netlify-identity-widget opens
3. User enters email/password
4. Widget calls same `POST /.netlify/identity/token` endpoint
5. Receives same JWT access token
6. Stores in localStorage
7. Calls `/me` endpoint
8. Shows main CRM interface

## âœ… Perfect Compatibility:

- âœ… **Same backend**: https://trusenda.com/.netlify/functions/
- âœ… **Same database**: Neon PostgreSQL
- âœ… **Same auth**: Netlify Identity JWT tokens
- âœ… **Same API calls**: All endpoints identical
- âœ… **Interoperable**: Users can switch between web and iOS seamlessly

## Test It:

Login with your existing Trusenda account:
- Email: (your trusenda email)
- Password: (your trusenda password)

The iOS app will:
1. âœ… Login successfully
2. âœ… Show same leads as web app
3. âœ… Allow creating/editing/deleting leads
4. âœ… Sync instantly with web app (same database)

**No changes to your React web app required!** ðŸŽ‰
