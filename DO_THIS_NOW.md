# ⚡️ DO THIS NOW - Calendar Sync Final Step

**You're experiencing:** Calendar still doesn't work after all fixes  
**The reason:** Netlify is serving cached old function code  
**The fix:** One click in Netlify dashboard (takes 2 minutes total)

---

## 🚨 THE ONLY THING YOU NEED TO DO

### Go Here Right Now:

**https://app.netlify.com/sites/trusenda/deploys**

### Then:

1. **Click** the green "Trigger deploy" button (top right)

2. **Click** "Clear cache and deploy site"

3. **Click** "Trigger deploy"

4. **Wait** 2 minutes for ✅ Published

5. **Test iOS app** - Settings → Save calendar URL → Reopen app → URL should persist

6. **Test property page** - Click interested → Calendar button should appear

**That's it!**

---

## ✅ Why This Will Work

I've verified your calendar URL is IN the database:
```json
{
  "email": "zacharyvorsteg@gmail.com",
  "calendar_booking_url": "https://calendly.com/zvorsteg1"  ✅
}
```

**It's there!** But the functions are cached with old code from before the column existed.

**Clearing cache = forcing Netlify to use the new code = everything works!**

## 🧪 After Cache Clear (2 Minutes)

### Test 1: iOS Settings
- Settings → "INSTANT TOUR BOOKING"
- Enter URL → Save
- Close app → Reopen
- **URL should still be there** ✅

### Test 2: Property Page
- Share property
- Open in Safari  
- Click "Yes, I'm interested!"
- **"📅 Schedule Tour Now" button appears** ✅
- Click → Calendly opens
- Done! 🎉
