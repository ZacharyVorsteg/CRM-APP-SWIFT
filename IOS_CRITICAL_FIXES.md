# iOS App Critical Fixes - Lead Editing & Public Form Links

**Date:** October 19, 2025  
**Issues Addressed:** Lead editing not saving + Public form link reliability  
**Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED

---

## üéØ Issues Reported

### Issue #1: Lead Editing Not Saving
**Problem:** When editing leads in the iOS app (especially the notes field), changes weren't being saved to the backend.

**Root Cause:** The `LeadUpdatePayload` struct was using Swift's default `Codable` encoding, which includes ALL properties (even nil ones as null values). This caused the backend to receive and process empty/null values, potentially overwriting existing data.

**Example of the Problem:**
```json
// iOS was sending:
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "notes": "Updated notes",
  "phone": null,        // ‚ùå Unintended null
  "company": null,      // ‚ùå Unintended null
  "budget": null        // ‚ùå Unintended null
  // ... all other fields as null
}

// Backend would process ALL these fields, including nulls
```

### Issue #2: Public Form Link Not Working Reliably
**Problem:** When copying/sharing the public form link from the iOS app, the link didn't work reliably when opened by recipients.

**Root Cause:** While the URL format was correct (`https://trusenda.com/submit/{slug}`), the iOS app lacked:
- Clear indication that the link is tappable/testable
- Debugging capabilities to verify the link works
- User-friendly error handling
- Clear instructions about what the link does

## ‚úÖ Solutions Implemented

### Fix #1: Lead Update Payload Encoding

**Location:** `/TrusendaCRM/Core/Models/Lead.swift`

**What Changed:**
Added a custom `encode(to:)` function to the `LeadUpdatePayload` struct that only includes non-nil values in the JSON payload.

**Code Added:**
```swift
// Custom encoder that only includes non-nil values
// This prevents sending null values that would overwrite existing data
func encode(to encoder: Encoder) throws {
    var container = encoder.container(keyedBy: CodingKeys.self)
    
    // Only encode non-nil values
    try container.encodeIfPresent(name, forKey: .name)
    try container.encodeIfPresent(email, forKey: .email)
    try container.encodeIfPresent(phone, forKey: .phone)
    try container.encodeIfPresent(company, forKey: .company)
    try container.encodeIfPresent(budget, forKey: .budget)
    try container.encodeIfPresent(notes, forKey: .notes)
    // ... all other fields using encodeIfPresent
}
```

**How It Works:**
- `encodeIfPresent()` only adds a field to the JSON if it has a non-nil value
- Backend only receives fields that are actually being updated
- Existing data in other fields remains untouched

**Example of Fixed Behavior:**
```json
// iOS now sends only what's being updated:
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "notes": "Updated notes"
}
// ‚úÖ Other fields not included, so backend doesn't touch them
```

### Fix #2: Public Form Link Enhancements

**Location:** `/TrusendaCRM/Features/Settings/SettingsView.swift`

**What Changed:**
1. ‚úÖ Added clear description of what the link does
2. ‚úÖ Made the URL display tappable to open in Safari
3. ‚úÖ Enhanced copy button with better success feedback
4. ‚úÖ Improved ShareLink with custom message
5. ‚úÖ Added "Test Link in Safari" button for debugging
6. ‚úÖ Comprehensive logging for troubleshooting

**New Features:**

#### 1. Tappable URL Display
```swift
// Tap the URL to open it directly in Safari
Button {
    if let url = URL(string: form.fullURL) {
        UIApplication.shared.open(url)
    }
} label: {
    Text(form.fullURL)
        .font(.system(size: 13, weight: .medium, design: .monospaced))
        .foregroundColor(.primaryBlue)
}
```

#### 2. Enhanced Copy Button
```swift
Button {
    UIPasteboard.general.string = form.fullURL
    UINotificationFeedbackGenerator().notificationOccurred(.success)
    settingsViewModel.successMessage = "‚úÖ Link copied to clipboard!"
    print("üìã Copied public form link: \(form.fullURL)")
}
```

#### 3. Improved ShareLink
```swift
ShareLink(item: url, message: Text("Submit leads to my CRM")) {
    Label("Share", systemImage: "square.and.arrow.up")
}
```

#### 4. Test Button with Error Handling
```swift
Button {
    if let url = URL(string: form.fullURL) {
        UIApplication.shared.open(url, options: [:]) { success in
            if success {
                print("‚úÖ Successfully opened form in Safari")
            } else {
                print("‚ùå Failed to open form in Safari")
                settingsViewModel.error = "Unable to open form link"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## üß™ Testing Guide

### Test #1: Lead Editing

**Steps to Test:**
1. Open the iOS app
2. Navigate to any lead
3. Tap "Edit" (pencil icon in top-right)
4. Edit the **Notes** field (add or change text)
5. Edit 1-2 other fields (e.g., Company, Industry)
6. Tap "Save"
7. Close and reopen the lead detail view
8. ‚úÖ **Verify:** All changes are persisted correctly

**Also Test:**
- Edit ONLY the notes field (leave other fields unchanged)
- Edit ONLY the status field
- Edit multiple fields at once
- Clear a field (make it empty) and save

**Expected Result:**
- ‚úÖ All changes save correctly
- ‚úÖ Fields you didn't edit remain unchanged
- ‚úÖ No data loss or unintended overwrites

### Test #2: Public Form Link

**Steps to Test:**

#### A. Copy & Paste Test
1. Open Settings ‚Üí Public Form section
2. Tap "Copy Link"
3. See success message: "‚úÖ Link copied to clipboard!"
4. Open Messages or Notes app
5. Paste the link
6. Tap the pasted link
7. ‚úÖ **Verify:** Safari opens to `https://trusenda.com/submit/{your-slug}`
8. ‚úÖ **Verify:** Form loads correctly and displays your business name

#### B. Share Button Test
1. Open Settings ‚Üí Public Form section
2. Tap "Share" button
3. Select a method (Messages, Email, etc.)
4. Send to another device or contact
5. Open the link on the recipient's device
6. ‚úÖ **Verify:** Form loads and works properly

#### C. Test Link Button
1. Open Settings ‚Üí Public Form section
2. Tap "Test Link in Safari"
3. ‚úÖ **Verify:** Safari opens with your public form
4. Fill out the form and submit

#### D. Form Submission Test
1. Share the link to a friend or second device
2. Have them fill out the form completely
3. Submit the form
4. Pull to refresh in your iOS app's Leads list
5. ‚úÖ **Verify:** New lead appears with all submitted data

## üîç Technical Details

### Backend Compatibility

The fixes maintain 100% compatibility with the shared backend:

**Lead Update Endpoint:** `PUT /.netlify/functions/customers/:id`
- Backend uses `normalizeLeadUpdate()` which checks `if ('field' in updates)`
- iOS now sends only fields being updated
- Backend processes only provided fields ‚úÖ

**Public Form Endpoint:** `GET /.netlify/functions/get-public-form?slug={slug}`
- iOS uses same URL format as web app
- Both frontends hit same backend
- Form submission to same `ingest-lead` function ‚úÖ

### Encoding Strategy

**Before (Problematic):**
```swift
// Default Codable encoding
let payload = LeadUpdatePayload()
payload.notes = "New notes"
// Encodes ALL fields (including nil ones as null)
```

**After (Fixed):**
```swift
// Custom encoder
let payload = LeadUpdatePayload()
payload.notes = "New notes"
// Only encodes non-nil fields via encodeIfPresent()
```

### URL Validation

The iOS app now validates URLs at multiple points:
```swift
// 1. Parse URL from string
guard let url = URL(string: form.fullURL) else {
    print("‚ùå Invalid URL format")
    return
}

// 2. Attempt to open with callback
UIApplication.shared.open(url, options: [:]) { success in
    if success {
        print("‚úÖ Successfully opened")
    } else {
        print("‚ùå Failed to open")
    }
}
```

## üöÄ Next Steps

### For You (Testing)
1. ‚úÖ Build the updated iOS app in Xcode
2. ‚úÖ Test lead editing (especially notes field)
3. ‚úÖ Test public form link copy/share/open
4. ‚úÖ Submit a test lead through the public form
5. ‚úÖ Verify the test lead appears in your CRM

### Build Instructions
```bash
# Navigate to the iOS project
cd /Users/zachthomas/Desktop/CRM-APP-SWIFT

# Open in Xcode
open TrusendaCRM.xcodeproj

# Or build from command line:
xcodebuild -project TrusendaCRM.xcodeproj \
  -scheme TrusendaCRM \
  -configuration Debug \
  -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 15 Pro' \
  build
```

### If Issues Persist

**Lead Editing Issues:**
- Check Xcode console for PUT request logs
- Verify response shows updated customer data
- Check that `encodeIfPresent` is being called (add breakpoint)

**Public Form Link Issues:**
- Use "Test Link in Safari" button in Settings
- Check console logs for "üìã Copied public form link"
- Verify slug is not empty: `print("Slug: \(form.slug)")`
- Test the exact URL in desktop Safari first
