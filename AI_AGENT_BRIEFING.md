# Trusenda CRM - AI Agent Briefing

## Project Context
Trusenda is a Commercial & Industrial Real Estate CRM with two synchronized frontends:
1. **iOS Native App** (SwiftUI) - `/Users/zachthomas/Desktop/CRM-APP-SWIFT/`
2. **Cloud Web App** - Production site that sets the "source of truth" for features/UX

## Critical Understanding
- The iOS app MUST maintain perfect parity with cloud features while feeling native to iOS
- Both frontends share the same backend/database schema
- Changes should only be made to the Swift app, but must reference cloud functionality

## Current Status & Progress
1. **Authentication & Branding** ✅ COMPLETE
   - Auto-login after signup implemented
   - **Persistent sessions** - users stay logged in (Oct 22, 2025)
   - **Automatic token refresh** - seamless session restoration
   - Welcome tour for new users added
   - Logo fully integrated across all touchpoints:
     * App Icon (1024x1024 in AppIcon.appiconset)
     * Login/SignUp screens (simplified loading)
     * NEW: Enterprise splash screen on every app entry
   - Assets.xcassets properly configured with @1x, @2x, @3x scales

2. **Lead Management**
   - Contact import feature added
   - Dropdowns match cloud site (Budget, Size Range, Industry, Lease Term, Transaction Type)
   - Follow-up logic aligned with cloud version
   - Date parsing handles both formats: "YYYY-MM-DD" and "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.SSSZ"

3. **UI/UX Achievements**
   - "Salesforce-Apple hybrid" aesthetic implemented
   - Consistent colors, typography, shadows across all screens
   - Premium gradients and animations added
   - Settings view conflicts resolved

## Active Issues - All Resolved ✅

1. **Follow-up System** ✅ WORKING
   - Follow-up badges and counts match cloud behavior exactly
   - Date comparison logic uses Calendar.startOfDay for consistency
   - Follow-up card displays with "Task:" prefix and clear date formatting

2. **Contact Import** ✅ WORKING
   - Sheet presentation uses item binding for reliable data passing
   - Handles permissions and background thread processing
   - Pre-fills name, email, phone with option to complete other fields

3. **Visual Polish** ✅ COMPLETE
   - Trusenda logo fully integrated:
     * App icon on home screen

6. **Stripe Checkout** ✅ FIXED (Oct 17, 2025)
   - Backend returns complete Stripe checkout URL (not just session ID)
   - iOS app uses URL directly from backend
   - Fixes "page not found" error when upgrading to Pro
   - No more manual URL construction
   - See STRIPE_CHECKOUT_FIX.md for details

7. **New User Onboarding Flow** ✅ PERFECTED (Oct 17, 2025)

   - See LINK_SHARING_FIX.md and QUICK_FIX_SUMMARY.md for details

9. **Authentication Persistence** ✅ FIXED (Oct 22, 2025) - CRITICAL
   - Users now stay logged in indefinitely (until manual logout)
   - Automatic token refresh on app reopen (no more unexpected logouts)
   - Optimistic authentication state (no flash of login screen)
   - Comprehensive token restoration flow:
     * Check for any tokens (access OR refresh)
     * Try access token if valid
     * Auto-refresh if access token expired but refresh token valid
     * Only logout if both tokens invalid
   - Perfect cloud parity - matches web app session behavior
   - Enhanced debug logging for troubleshooting
   - See AUTHENTICATION_PERSISTENCE_FIX.md for full details

## Technical Details
1. **SwiftUI Architecture**
