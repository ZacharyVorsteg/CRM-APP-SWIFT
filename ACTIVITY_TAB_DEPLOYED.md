**Date:** October 21, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE - Ready to Build

## 🎯 What Was Done

### 1. Added RecentActivityView to Xcode Project ✅
**Reverse Engineered Xcode project.pbxproj:**
- Added `APP021` build file reference
- Added `FILE021` file reference  
- Created `ACTIVITYGROUP` in Features
- Added to `PBXSourcesBuildPhase`
- File now recognized by Xcode compiler

### 2. Enabled Activity Tab in App ✅
**Modified TrusendaCRMApp.swift:**
- Uncommented `RecentActivityView()`
- Added tab between Follow-Ups and Settings
- 4-tab layout now active

### 3. Fixed Follow-Ups Gradient ✅
**Corrected to match top circle:**
- Changed from orange gradient
- Now uses: Blue → Green gradient
- Matches top circle aesthetic perfectly

## 📱 Tab Bar Layout (Final)

```
┌──────────┬────────────┬──────────┬──────────┐
│  Leads   │ Follow-Ups │ Activity │ Settings │
│    👥    │     📅     │    🔄    │    ⚙️   │
│          │  (Badge)   │  (NEW!)  │          │
└──────────┴────────────┴──────────┴──────────┘
```

**Tab Order:**
1. **Leads** - Main CRM interface
2. **Follow-Ups** - Task queue with badge count
3. **Activity** - Recent activity feed (NEW!)
4. **Settings** - App configuration
