## ✅ ALL FIXES APPLIED

### Fix 1: Extracted PropertiesListView Body Components

**Problem:** The main `body` view had too many nested views (~200 lines) causing compiler timeout.

**Solution:** Broke down into smaller computed properties:

```swift
// Before: Massive body with everything inline
var body: some View {
    NavigationView {
        ZStack {
            // 200+ lines of nested views 😵
        }
    }
}

// After: Clean, modular structure
var body: some View {
    NavigationView {
        ZStack {
            matchNotificationBadge  // ✅ Extracted
            if filteredProperties.isEmpty {
                emptyStateView      // ✅ Extracted
            } else {
                // Properties grid...
            }
        }
    }
}

// New computed properties
private var matchNotificationBadge: some View { ... }
private var emptyStateView: some View { ... }
```

**Components Created:**
1. ✅ `matchNotificationBadge` - Orange "New Match!" notification
2. ✅ `emptyStateView` - Beautiful empty state with icon and tip

---

### Fix 2: Removed Incorrect UUID String Conversions

**Problem:** `property.id` and `lead.id` are already `String` types, not `UUID` objects.

**Before (❌ Error):**
```swift
property.id.uuidString  // ❌ String has no member 'uuidString'
lead.id.uuidString      // ❌ String has no member 'uuidString'
```

**After (✅ Fixed):**
```swift
property.id  // ✅ Already a String!
lead.id      // ✅ Already a String!
```

**Lines Fixed:**
- Line 560: `propertyURL` computed property
- Line 568: `trackedURL(for:)` function

---

All previous fixes to `PropertyMatchesSheet` remain intact:
- ✅ Collapsible lead cards
- ✅ Match reasoning display
