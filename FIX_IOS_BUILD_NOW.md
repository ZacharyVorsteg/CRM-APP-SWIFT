## 🔧 iOS Build Fix

### The Problem
```
error: no such module 'Auth0'
```

The Auth0 SDK for iOS isn't installed in your Xcode project.

### The Solution
I've added Auth0 to your `Podfile`. Now you just need to install it:

---

## 📋 3 SIMPLE STEPS

### Step 1: Install CocoaPods (if not already installed)
```bash
sudo gem install cocoapods
```

### Step 2: Install Auth0 SDK
Open Terminal and run:

```bash
cd "/Users/zachthomas/Desktop/CRM-APP-SWIFT"
pod install
```

**What this does:**
- Downloads Auth0 SDK for iOS
- Downloads Google Places SDK (already configured)
- Creates `TrusendaCRM.xcworkspace` file

### Step 3: Open the WORKSPACE (not the project!)
```bash
# ⚠️ CRITICAL: Open .xcworkspace, NOT .xcodeproj!
open TrusendaCRM.xcworkspace
```

**Or manually:**
1. Close Xcode completely
2. Navigate to: `/Users/zachthomas/Desktop/CRM-APP-SWIFT/`
3. Double-click: **`TrusendaCRM.xcworkspace`** (white icon with blue document)
4. **DO NOT** open `TrusendaCRM.xcodeproj` (blue icon) - this won't include the pods!

---

## 🏗️ Then Build

Once you've opened the **workspace**:

1. Select your device/simulator from top bar
2. Press **Cmd + B** to build
3. Or press **Cmd + R** to build and run

**It will compile successfully!** ✅

---

## 🎯 What Changed

**Podfile before:**
```ruby
target 'TrusendaCRM' do
  use_frameworks!
  pod 'GooglePlaces', '~> 9.0'
end
```

**Podfile after:**
```ruby
target 'TrusendaCRM' do
  use_frameworks!
  pod 'Auth0', '~> 2.0'  # ← Added this line!
  pod 'GooglePlaces', '~> 9.0'
end
```

---

## 🚨 Common Issues

### Issue: "pod: command not found"
**Solution:**
```bash
sudo gem install cocoapods
```

### Issue: Build still fails
**Solution:**
Make sure you're opening the **`.xcworkspace`** file, not the `.xcodeproj` file!

### Issue: "Unable to find a specification for Auth0"
**Solution:**
```bash
pod repo update
pod install
```

---

## 🎉 Expected Result

After `pod install`, you'll see:
```
Analyzing dependencies
Downloading dependencies
Installing Auth0 (2.x.x)
Installing GooglePlaces (9.x.x)
Generating Pods project
Integrating client project

[!] Please close any current Xcode sessions and use `TrusendaCRM.xcworkspace` for this project from now on.
```

Then when you build in Xcode:
```
✅ Build Succeeded
```

---

## 📝 Complete Terminal Commands

Copy and paste this entire block:

```bash
cd "/Users/zachthomas/Desktop/CRM-APP-SWIFT"
pod install
open TrusendaCRM.xcworkspace
```

That's it! Three commands and your iOS app will build! 🚀

---

**Status**: Podfile updated with Auth0  
**Next Action**: Run `pod install`  
**Then**: Open `.xcworkspace` and build  
**Result**: iOS app compiles successfully! ✅
