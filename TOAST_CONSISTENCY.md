**Date:** October 17, 2025  
**Feature:** Matching Premium Animations  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

## 🎯 Perfect Visual Parity

### Lead Added Toast
```
╔════════════════════════════════════════╗
║ ✓  Lead added        [UNDO & EDIT]    ║
║    successfully                        ║
╚════════════════════════════════════════╝
```

### Leads Deleted Toast
```
╔════════════════════════════════════════╗
║ ✓  Deleted 2 leads                    ║
║    successfully                        ║
╚════════════════════════════════════════╝
```

**Difference:** No undo button (makes sense - can't easily undo bulk delete)

## 📊 Animation Sequence (Frame by Frame)

### Both Toasts Follow Identical Pattern

**Frame 0 (0.0s):**
```
- Toast below screen
- Opacity: 0
- Checkmark scale: 0.5
- Checkmark rotation: -90°
```

**Frame 1 (0.1s):**
```

- Opacity: 0 → 1.0 (spring)
- Checkmark begins animation
```

**Frame 2 (0.7s):**
```
- Toast fully visible
- Opacity: 1.0
- Checkmark scale: 1.0
- Checkmark rotation: 0°
- Animation complete ✨
```

**Frame 3 (3.0s):**
```
- Hold display
- User reads message
```

**Frame 4 (3.4s):**

## 🎨 Code Comparison

### Checkmark Animation (Identical)
```swift
// Both toasts use:
@State private var checkmarkScale: CGFloat = 0.5
@State private var checkmarkRotation: Double = -90

Image(systemName: "checkmark.circle.fill")
    .font(.system(size: 28, weight: .bold))
    .foregroundColor(.white)
    .scaleEffect(checkmarkScale)
    .rotationEffect(.degrees(checkmarkRotation))

withAnimation(.spring(response: 0.7, dampingFraction: 0.65).delay(0.1)) {
    checkmarkScale = 1.0
    checkmarkRotation = 0
}
```

### Gradient Background (Identical)
```swift
// Both toasts use:
LinearGradient(
    colors: [adaptiveGreen, adaptiveMint],
    startPoint: .topLeading,
    endPoint: .bottomTrailing
)

// Light Mode:
adaptiveGreen: #2ECC71 (rgb 0.18, 0.80, 0.44)
adaptiveMint:  rgb(0.20, 0.89, 0.65)

// Dark Mode:
adaptiveGreen: rgb(0.15, 0.70, 0.30)
adaptiveMint:  rgb(0.10, 0.60, 0.40)
```

### Shadow Layers (Identical)
```swift
// Both toasts use:
.shadow(color: Color.black.opacity(0.15), radius: 8, x: 0, y: 4)
.shadow(color: adaptiveGreen.opacity(0.35), radius: 12, x: 0, y: 6)
```

## 🔍 Differences (By Design)

### Text Content
**Add Lead:**
```swift
Text("Lead added")
```

**Delete Leads:**
```swift
Text("Deleted \(count) lead\(count == 1 ? "" : "s")")
```

**Smart Pluralization:**
- 1 lead: "Deleted 1 lead"
- 2+ leads: "Deleted 2 leads"

### Button Presence
**Add Lead:**
- ✅ Has "UNDO & EDIT" button
- Allows immediate correction
- Reopens modal with data

**Delete Leads:**
- ❌ No button
- Bulk delete can't be easily undone
- Cleaner, simpler design

## 🎯 User Experience

### Consistent Feel Across Actions

**User Adds Lead:**
1. Fills form
2. Taps "Save"
3. Premium green toast slides up
4. Checkmark rotates and scales
5. Reads "Lead added successfully"
6. Can tap "UNDO & EDIT" if needed
7. Toast auto-dismisses after 3s

**User Deletes Multiple Leads:**
1. Selects leads
2. Taps "Delete X Leads"
3. Confirms in alert
4. Sees deletion progress overlay
5. Premium green toast slides up ← **Same animation!**
6. Checkmark rotates and scales ← **Same animation!**
7. Reads "Deleted X leads successfully"
8. Toast auto-dismisses after 3s ← **Same timing!**

**Result:** User feels consistency. Both success actions use the same premium feedback.
