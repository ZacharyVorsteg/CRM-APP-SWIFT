# 🔧 FIX: Build Pods Before App

## 🎯 The Problem

Auth0 pod is installed, but the **framework hasn't been built yet**. Xcode tries to build your app before building the dependencies.

---

## ✅ THE FIX (In Xcode)

### Step 1: Build Pods Scheme First

In Xcode's top toolbar (next to Play/Stop buttons):

1. **Click the scheme dropdown** (currently shows "TrusendaCRM")
2. **Select**: `Pods-TrusendaCRM`
3. **Press Cmd + B** to build
4. **Wait for "Build Succeeded"** (should take 10-30 seconds)

This builds all the Pod frameworks including Auth0.

### Step 2: Switch Back to App Scheme

1. **Click the scheme dropdown** again
2. **Select**: `TrusendaCRM` 
3. **Press Cmd + B** to build
4. **Build will succeed!** ✅

---

## 🎯 Alternative: Build Everything

Just press **Cmd + R** (Run) instead of Cmd + B (Build).

This automatically:
1. Builds Pods first
2. Then builds your app
3. Then runs on simulator/device

**This might be easiest!**

---

## 🔍 Why This Happens

CocoaPods creates multiple build targets:
- `Pods-TrusendaCRM` (the dependencies)
- `TrusendaCRM` (your app)

Normally Xcode builds them in the right order, but sometimes after a fresh pod install, you need to build Pods manually first.

---

## 📋 Visual Guide

**Top of Xcode window:**
```
[Scheme dropdown: TrusendaCRM ▼] [Any iOS Device ▼] [▶︎ Run button]
```

**Click that dropdown, you'll see:**
```
TrusendaCRM               ← Your app
Pods-TrusendaCRM          ← Build THIS first!
```

---

## 🚨 Still Not Working?

### Nuclear Option:

In Xcode:
1. **Product** → **Clean Build Folder** (Shift + Cmd + K)
2. **File** → **Close Workspace**
3. In Terminal:
```bash
cd "/Users/zachthomas/Desktop/CRM-APP-SWIFT"
rm -rf ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData
pod deintegrate
pod install
open TrusendaCRM.xcworkspace
```
4. In Xcode: Select `Pods-TrusendaCRM` scheme → Cmd + B
5. Then: Select `TrusendaCRM` scheme → Cmd + B

---

## 🎉 Expected Result

After building Pods scheme:
```
Build target Auth0 of project Pods
✓ Compiling Auth0 sources...
✓ Auth0.framework created

Build target JWTDecode of project Pods
✓ JWTDecode.framework created

Build target SimpleKeychain of project Pods
✓ SimpleKeychain.framework created

Build succeeded
```

After building TrusendaCRM scheme:
```
Import Auth0 ✅ (now found!)
✓ Compiling LoginView.swift
✓ Compiling AuthManager.swift
...
Build succeeded ✅
```

---

**TL;DR in Xcode:**
1. Switch scheme to `Pods-TrusendaCRM` → Build (Cmd+B)
2. Switch scheme to `TrusendaCRM` → Build (Cmd+B)
3. Done! ✅

Or just press **Cmd + R** and it builds everything automatically!
