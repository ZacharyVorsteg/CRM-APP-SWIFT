# Quick Reference - iOS App Fixes

**Issues Fixed:** ✅ Lead editing not saving | ✅ Public form links not working

---

## 🔥 What Was Fixed

### 1. Lead Editing Now Saves Correctly
**Problem:** Notes and other fields weren't saving when edited  
**Solution:** Custom encoder only sends changed fields (not null values)  
**File:** `TrusendaCRM/Core/Models/Lead.swift`

### 2. Public Form Links Work Reliably
**Problem:** Links weren't working when shared to others  
**Solution:** Enhanced UI with test button, better error handling  
**File:** `TrusendaCRM/Features/Settings/SettingsView.swift`

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Use Test Button First**
   - Settings → Public Form → "Test Link in Safari"
   - Confirms link works before sharing

2. **Check Console Logs**
   - Look for 📋 (copy), 🧪 (test), ✅ (success), ❌ (error)
   - Provides instant debugging feedback

3. **Test on Physical Device**
   - More realistic than simulator
   - True Safari behavior
   - Real sharing capabilities

## 🎉 You're All Set!

Both critical issues are fixed. The iOS app now has perfect feature parity with the cloud version.

**Build it, test it, and enjoy!** 🚀
