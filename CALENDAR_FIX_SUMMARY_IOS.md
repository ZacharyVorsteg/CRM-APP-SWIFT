# iOS App - Calendar Sync Fix Summary

**Date:** October 22, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED - Ready for Testing

---

## 🔴 The Problem You Reported

> "The calendar sync isn't working. People should be able to have the app interoperable with their Outlook etc. when someone clicks 'Yes, I'm interested' from the shared property form."

**What Was Broken:**

From the iOS app logs, you were getting:
```
📝 Saving calendar URL (attempt 1): https://calendly.com/zvorsteg1
📤 PATCH https://trusenda.com/.netlify/functions/user-settings
❌ Failed to save calendar URL: serverError(500, Optional("Internal server error"))
```

**Root Cause:** The backend database was missing the `calendar_booking_url` column in the `users` table.

---

## ✅ What I Fixed

### 1. Backend Database Auto-Migration

**File:** `netlify/functions/lib/neonAdapter.js` (Cloud CRM - shared backend)

**Change:** Added automatic migration to create `calendar_booking_url` column:

```javascript
// Add calendar_booking_url column to users table (for Calendly, Google Calendar, etc.)
await client.query(`
  DO $$ 
  BEGIN 
    IF NOT EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM information_schema.columns 
      WHERE table_name='users' AND column_name='calendar_booking_url'
    ) THEN
      ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN calendar_booking_url VARCHAR(500);
    END IF;
  END $$;
`);
```

**Result:** Column is created automatically on next backend request. iOS app's 500 error will be fixed!

### 2. Calendar URL Return in Property Interest

**File:** `netlify/functions/property-interest.js` (Cloud CRM - shared backend)

**Change:** When leads click "Yes, I'm interested!", backend now:
- Fetches property owner's calendar URL from database
- Returns it in the response

**Code:**
```javascript
// Fetch property owner's calendar booking URL (for instant tour scheduling)
const userResult = await client.query(`
  SELECT calendar_booking_url 
  FROM users 
  WHERE email = $1
`, [brokerEmail]);

if (userResult.rows.length > 0 && userResult.rows[0].calendar_booking_url) {
  calendarBookingUrl = userResult.rows[0].calendar_booking_url;
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Interest recorded",
  "calendarBookingUrl": "https://calendly.com/zvorsteg1" // Or null if not set
}
```

---

### 3. Web Property Page Calendar Display

**File:** `src/pages/Property.jsx` (Cloud CRM - shared frontend)

**Change:** Added calendar booking button that appears after clicking "Yes, I'm interested!":

```javascript
{responseType === 'yes' && calendarBookingUrl && (
  <a href={calendarBookingUrl} target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
    📅 Schedule Tour Now →
  </a>
)}
```

**Result:** Leads can instantly book tours via Calendly, Google Calendar, Outlook, etc.

## 📱 iOS App Status

**No iOS code changes were needed!** Your existing Swift code is already perfect:

### What Already Works in iOS App:

1. **Settings Screen** (`TrusendaCRM/Features/Settings/SettingsView.swift`)
   - ✅ "INSTANT TOUR BOOKING" section exists
   - ✅ TextField for calendar URL
   - ✅ Save button with validation (https:// check)
   - ✅ APIClient.shared.patch() calls user-settings endpoint
   - ✅ Success/error handling with feedback

2. **Calendar Booking View** (`TrusendaCRM/Features/Properties/CalendarBookingView.swift`)
   - ✅ WebView component for displaying calendars
   - ✅ Loading states & error handling
   - ✅ Navigation controls

3. **API Models** (`TrusendaCRM/Core/Models/APIResponses.swift`)

   - ✅ Proper Codable conformance

4. **Network Layer** (`TrusendaCRM/Core/Network/APIClient.swift`)
   - ✅ PATCH method with body encoding
   - ✅ Bearer token authentication

## 🎯 iOS Feature Parity Maintained

As per `AI_AGENT_BRIEFING.md`, the iOS app maintains perfect parity with cloud features:

### Calendar Integration Parity:

| Feature | Cloud Web App | iOS App | Status |
|---------|---------------|---------|--------|
| Save calendar URL | ✅ Settings page | ✅ Settings screen | ✅ Parity |
| Validate HTTPS | ✅ Backend check | ✅ Swift validation | ✅ Parity |
| Display booking on property | ✅ Property.jsx | ✅ Via web (shared links) | ✅ Parity |
| Supported services | ✅ Any HTTPS | ✅ Any HTTPS | ✅ Parity |
| Error handling | ✅ User-friendly | ✅ User-friendly | ✅ Parity |

**Note:** Public property viewing happens on web (Property.jsx), not in iOS app. This is intentional - iOS app is for realtors managing their CRM, web is for leads viewing shared properties.

---

## 🚀 What Happens After You Deploy

### Immediate Impact:

1. **iOS App Settings:**
   - You can successfully save your Calendly URL
   - No more 500 errors
   - URL persists across app sessions

2. **Property Sharing:**

   - Instant tour booking = better conversion
   - Less manual scheduling work for you

3. **Lead Experience:**
   - One-click tour booking
   - Professional, modern UX
   - Works with their preferred calendar app

### Analytics (You'll See):
