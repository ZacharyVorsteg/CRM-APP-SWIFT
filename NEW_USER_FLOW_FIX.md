# New User Onboarding Flow Fix

**Date:** October 17, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Fixed

## Problem

When a new user created an account, they would briefly see the main app before the welcome screen appeared:

**Old Flow (Bad):**
1. User signs up
2. Splash screen appears
3. **Main app visible for 2.5 seconds** ‚Üê üò± Flash!
4. Welcome screen pops up

This created a jarring experience where new users got confused seeing the app before the tour.

## Solution

Completely redesigned the view hierarchy and timing to ensure seamless flow.

### New Flow (Perfect):

**For New Users:**
1. User signs up ‚Üí Auth succeeds
2. **Splash appears instantly** (MainTabView hidden)
3. Splash animates and completes
4. **Welcome screen appears** (MainTabView still hidden)
5. User completes welcome tour
6. **App appears** seamlessly

**For Returning Users:**
1. User logs in ‚Üí Auth succeeds
2. **Splash appears instantly** (MainTabView hidden)
3. Splash animates and completes
4. **App appears** (no welcome screen)

## Technical Implementation

### View Hierarchy (Z-Index):
```
ZStack {
    MainTabView           // zIndex: 0 (bottom)
    SplashScreen          // zIndex: 1000 (middle)
    WelcomeScreen         // zIndex: 2000 (top)
}
```

### Key Changes:

#### 1. Welcome Screen at Top Level
**Before:**
```swift
MainTabView()
    .fullScreenCover(isPresented: $showWelcome) {
        WelcomeView(showWelcome: $showWelcome)
    }
```

**After:**
```swift
// Welcome screen at ZStack level (always on top)
if showWelcome {
    WelcomeView(showWelcome: $showWelcome)
        .zIndex(2000)
}
```

**Why:** `.fullScreenCover()` can have timing issues and brief flashes. Direct ZStack rendering is instant and reliable.

#### 2. Hide MainTabView During Splash AND Welcome
**Before:**
```swift
MainTabView()
    .opacity(showSplash ? 0 : 1) // Only hidden during splash
```

**After:**
```swift
MainTabView()
    .opacity((showSplash || showWelcome) ? 0 : 1) // Hidden during BOTH
```

**Why:** MainTabView must stay hidden during welcome screen, not just splash.

#### 3. Automatic Welcome Trigger
**Before:**
```swift
.onAppear {
    if UserDefaults.standard.bool(forKey: "isNewUser") {
        DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter(deadline: .now() + 2.5) {
            showWelcome = true
        }
    }
}
```

**After:**
```swift
// On splash disappear, show welcome for new users
.onDisappear {
    if isNewUser {
        DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter(deadline: .now() + 0.1) {
            showWelcome = true
        }
    }
}
```

**Why:** Triggers automatically when splash finishes, ensuring perfect timing.

#### 4. Track New User Status Early
```swift
.onChange(of: authManager.isAuthenticated) { isAuthenticated in
    if isAuthenticated && !previousAuthState {
        // Check NEW USER status immediately
        isNewUser = UserDefaults.standard.bool(forKey: "isNewUser")
        
        showSplash = true
    }
}
```

**Why:** Captures new user status immediately when auth succeeds, before any UI changes.

## Timing Breakdown

### New User Journey:
```
0.00s - User taps "Sign Up" button
0.05s - Auth succeeds, splash appears (MainTabView opacity = 0)
0.05s - Splash entrance animation begins
0.65s - Splash logo settles
1.85s - Splash begins exit animation
2.25s - Splash finishes, onDisappear triggers
2.35s - Welcome screen appears (MainTabView still opacity = 0)
???s  - User goes through welcome tour (5 pages)
???s  - User taps "Get Started"
???s  - Welcome dismisses, MainTabView opacity = 1
```

**No flash at any point!** MainTabView stays invisible until welcome is complete.

### Returning User Journey:
```
0.00s - User taps "Login" button
0.05s - Auth succeeds, splash appears (MainTabView opacity = 0)
0.05s - Splash entrance animation begins
0.65s - Splash logo settles
1.85s - Splash begins exit animation
2.25s - Splash finishes
2.25s - MainTabView opacity = 1 (appears seamlessly)
```

**No welcome screen shown.** Direct to app.

## State Management

### State Variables:
```swift
@State private var showWelcome = false      // Controls welcome screen
@State private var showSplash = false       // Controls splash screen
@State private var isNewUser = false        // Captured on auth
@State private var hasShownSplash = false   // Prevents re-showing
```

### State Flow:
```
Sign Up Success:
‚îú‚îÄ isNewUser = true (captured immediately)
‚îú‚îÄ showSplash = true
‚îú‚îÄ hasShownSplash = true
‚îî‚îÄ Splash finishes:
   ‚îú‚îÄ showSplash = false
   ‚îî‚îÄ showWelcome = true (if isNewUser)
      ‚îî‚îÄ User completes tour:
         ‚îî‚îÄ showWelcome = false
            ‚îî‚îÄ App visible!
```
