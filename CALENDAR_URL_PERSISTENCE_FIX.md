# ‚úÖ Calendar URL Persistence & UX Fixes - Complete

**Date:** October 22, 2025  
**Status:** All Issues Fixed ‚úÖ

---

## üéØ Issues Fixed

### 1. ‚úÖ Calendar URL Persistence (CRITICAL)
**Problem:** Calendar URLs were not persisting when reopening the app, even though they were being saved successfully to the backend.

**Root Cause:** The calendar URL was only stored in the `@State` variable and loaded when SettingsView appeared. When the app restarted, the URL wasn't being loaded until the user navigated to Settings.

**Solution Implemented:**
- Added **UserDefaults caching** for instant local persistence
- Calendar URL now loads from cache immediately on app launch
- Backend fetch happens in background to sync latest URL
- Fallback system: Cache ‚Üí Backend ‚Üí Cached fallback if backend fails

**Code Changes:**
```swift
// Save: Store both to backend AND local cache
UserDefaults.standard.set(calendarBookingURL, forKey: "cached_calendar_booking_url")

// Load: Check cache first, then backend
if let cachedURL = UserDefaults.standard.string(forKey: "cached_calendar_booking_url") {
    calendarBookingURL = cachedURL  // Instant display
}
// Then fetch from backend to sync
```

### 2. ‚úÖ URL Validation - Only Allow Authenticated Calendar Links
**Problem:** No validation was in place to ensure only proper calendar service URLs were accepted.

**Solution Implemented:**
- Added `isValidCalendarURL()` function that validates against supported platforms
- Supported domains:
  - `calendly.com` ‚úÖ
  - `calendar.google.com` ‚úÖ
  - `outlook.office365.com` ‚úÖ
  - `outlook.live.com` ‚úÖ
  - `cal.com` ‚úÖ

**Code Changes:**
```swift
private func isValidCalendarURL(_ url: String) -> Bool {
    guard url.starts(with: "https://") else { return false }
    
    let supportedDomains = [
        "calendly.com",
        "calendar.google.com",
        "cal.com",
        "outlook.office365.com",
        "outlook.live.com"
    ]
    
    return supportedDomains.contains { url.contains($0) }
}
```

**User Feedback:**
- Shows clear error: "Please enter a valid calendar URL from Calendly, Google Calendar, Outlook, or Cal.com"
- Save button only appears for valid URLs

---

### 3. ‚úÖ Outlook Calendar Instructions Added
**Problem:** Setup guide only showed Calendly, Google Calendar, and Cal.com - missing Outlook which many commercial real estate professionals use.

**Solution Implemented:**
- Added **Microsoft Outlook** card to both setup guides:
  - `CalendarSetupGuideView.swift` - Full standalone guide
  - `CalendarGuideView` in `SettingsView.swift` - Embedded guide

**New Outlook Card:**
```swift
CalendarOptionCard(
    name: "Microsoft Outlook",
    icon: "üì®",
    description: "Free with Microsoft account. Office 365 integration.",
    url: "https://outlook.office365.com/owa/calendar",
    pros: ["Works with work email", "Office 365 sync", "Teams integration"]
)
```

---

### 4. ‚úÖ Fixed Obtrusive Setup Guide Behavior
**Problem:** Setup guide appeared too obtrusively when clicking save, interrupting the user flow.

**Solution Implemented:**
- Info button now only shows when **no URL is saved yet**
- Once URL is saved, info button disappears (cleaner UI)
- Help text changed to clickable link: "Calendly, Google Calendar, Outlook, or Cal.com (setup guide)"
- User can access guide only when they want it, not forced

**Code Changes:**
```swift
// Only show info button if no URL saved
if calendarBookingURL.isEmpty {
    Button {
        showCalendarGuide = true
    } label: {
        Image(systemName: "info.circle.fill")
    }
}

// Help text becomes clickable guide link
Button {
    showCalendarGuide = true
} label: {
    Text("Calendly, Google Calendar, Outlook, or Cal.com (setup guide)")
        .underline()
}
```

### 5. ‚úÖ Removed Floating "Pro Plan Active" Badge
**Problem:** Duplicate "Pro Plan Active" badge was showing when it shouldn't be visible (redundant with plan badge).

**Solution Implemented:**
- Removed redundant `Text(user.plan.capitalized)` display
- Now only shows clean badge: "PRO" or "FREE"
- Cleaner, less cluttered account section

**Before:**
```
Plan    pro    PRO
```

**After:**
```
Plan    PRO
```

---

### 6. ‚úÖ Improved Error Handling & Fallback System
**Problem:** No graceful degradation if backend fetch failed.

**Solution Implemented:**
- **Triple-layer reliability system:**
  1. **Cache first** - Instant display from UserDefaults
  2. **Backend fetch** - Sync latest from server
  3. **Cached fallback** - If backend fails, use cached URL

**Error Handling:**
- User-friendly error messages based on error type:
  - Unauthorized: "Session expired. Please log out and log back in."
  - Timeout: "Request timed out. Please check your internet connection."
  - Server Error: "Server error (400). Please try again."
  - Network Error: "Network error. Please check your internet connection."
  
- After 3 failed attempts: "Unable to save after 3 attempts. Please contact support@trusenda.com"

**Logging:**
```swift
print("üì± Loaded cached calendar URL:", cachedURL)
print("‚úÖ Loaded calendar URL from backend:", urlString)
print("üì± Using cached calendar URL as fallback")
```
