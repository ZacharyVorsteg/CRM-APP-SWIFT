# ✅ THE ONLY Settings View

**File**: `MainSettingsView.swift`

This is the ONLY Settings view that should exist in the entire project.

## To Fix Flickering (2 Minutes):

### Option 1: Run Script (Easiest)
Double-click this file on Desktop:
```
/Users/zachthomas/Desktop/CRM-APP-SWIFT/DELETE_OLD_SETTINGS.command
```

### Option 2: Manual in Xcode
1. In Xcode left sidebar
2. Navigate to: `TrusendaCRM` → `Features` → `Settings`
3. You should see 4 files. **DELETE THESE 3:**
   - ❌ `SettingsView.swift` (RIGHT-CLICK → DELETE → MOVE TO TRASH)
   - ❌ `EnhancedSettingsView.swift` (RIGHT-CLICK → DELETE → MOVE TO TRASH)
   - ❌ `CleanSettingsView.swift` (RIGHT-CLICK → DELETE → MOVE TO TRASH)

4. **KEEP ONLY THESE 2:**
   - ✅ `MainSettingsView.swift`
   - ✅ `SettingsViewModel.swift`

5. Clean and rebuild:
   - Press **⌘ + Shift + K** (Clean Build Folder)
   - Press **⌘ + B** (Build)
   - Press **⌘ + R** (Run)

## Result:

✅ **No more flickering**
✅ **Stable Settings view**
✅ **Professional, clean layout**

## What MainSettingsView Has:

- Account (Plan, Email, Lead Usage)
- Public Form (Copy/Share buttons)
- Billing (Upgrade OR Manage Subscription)
- Account Actions (Password, Export, Support, Sign Out, Delete)

**This is the final, production-ready version!**
