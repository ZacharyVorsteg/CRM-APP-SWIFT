# ✅ Honest Messaging - No False Promises

## Issue
Login screen showed "10,000 Leads" which is misleading if that's a pro-only feature.

## Ethical Fix Applied

### Before (Misleading):
```
[👥 10,000]
    Leads
```
❌ Promises specific capacity that may not be available

### After (Honest):
```
[📈 Manage]
    Pipeline

[☁️ Cloud]
    Synced
```
✅ Describes actual core features available to all users

---

## What Changed

### Left Side - Pipeline Management:
- **Icon**: Chart with upward trend
- **Text**: "Manage Pipeline"
- **Promise**: Core CRM functionality (true for everyone)

### Right Side - Cloud Sync:
- **Icon**: Cloud with upload arrow
- **Text**: "Cloud Synced"
- **Promise**: Real-time sync (actual feature)

## Why This Matters

### Ethical Marketing:
- ✅ No false promises
- ✅ Sets accurate expectations
- ✅ Builds trust from first impression
- ✅ No disappointment after login

### User Trust:

- No "bait and switch" feeling
