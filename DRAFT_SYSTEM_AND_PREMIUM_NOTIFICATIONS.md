# Draft System & Premium Notifications - Implementation Summary

**Date:** October 17, 2025  
**Feature:** Lead Draft Auto-Save & Premium Success Notifications  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

---

## 🎯 Overview

Implemented enterprise-grade draft system and premium success notifications for the Trusenda CRM iOS app, addressing critical UX gaps around data loss prevention and user feedback.

### Problems Solved

1. **Data Loss on Interruption**: Users lost lead input data when interrupted by calls, app backgrounding, or service loss
2. **Basic Success Notification**: Original success popup was flat, harsh, and lacked user recovery options
3. **No Undo Mechanism**: Users couldn't correct mistakes after adding leads
4. **Poor Visual Design**: Success notification lacked depth, animation, and premium feel

---

## ✨ New Features

### 1. Draft Auto-Save System

**Triggers:**
- App goes to background (ScenePhase .background)
- App becomes inactive (ScenePhase .inactive)
- User taps "Cancel" on AddLeadView
- Phone call received
- Low/no network connectivity

**Storage:**
- Uses `UserDefaults` for lightweight persistence
- Automatic JSON encoding/decoding
- Survives app termination

**User Experience:**
- Silent auto-save (no interruption)
- Smart detection: Only saves if meaningful content exists
- Resume prompt on next AddLeadView launch
- Timestamp display ("5 minutes ago", "1 hour ago")
- Optional: Discard draft or Resume with one tap

**Technical Implementation:**
```swift
// DraftManager.swift
- saveDraft(_:) - Persists draft with timestamp
- loadDraft() -> LeadDraft? - Retrieves saved draft
- clearDraft() - Removes draft after successful save
- hasDraft() -> Bool - Quick existence check

// LeadDraft Model
- All form fields captured
- savedAt timestamp for age calculation
- hasContent computed property
```

### 2. Premium Success Toast

**Visual Enhancements:**
- **Gradient Background**: Adaptive green (#2ECC71) to mint - darker in dark mode
- **Multiple Shadow Layers**: 
  - Black shadow (0.15 opacity, 8pt radius) for depth
  - Green glow (0.35 opacity, 12pt radius) for premium feel
- **16pt Corner Radius**: Smooth, modern edges
- **Typography Hierarchy**: 
  - "Lead added" - 16pt Bold, white
  - "successfully" - 13pt Regular, 85% opacity

**Animations:**
- **Checkmark Entrance**:
  - Scale: 0.5 → 1.0
  - Rotation: -90° → 0°
  - Spring animation (0.7s, 65% damping)
- **Toast Fade-In**: 0.6s spring response
- **Auto-Dismiss**: 3 second display, then 0.4s fade-out

**Interactions:**
- **UNDO & EDIT Button**:
  - Deletes just-added lead
  - Reopens AddLeadView with data pre-filled
  - Allows user to correct mistakes immediately
  - Haptic feedback on tap
- **Haptic Feedback**:
  - Success haptic on appear
  - Medium impact on undo tap

**Dark Mode:**
- Adaptive green colors (darker shades)
- Maintains contrast and readability

### 3. Undo & Edit Functionality

**Flow:**
1. User adds lead → Success toast appears
2. User taps "UNDO & EDIT"
3. Lead is deleted from database
4. Toast dismisses smoothly
5. AddLeadView reopens with all data pre-filled
6. User can correct mistake and re-save

**Technical Details:**
```swift
// LeadListView.swift
- Tracks lastAddedLead (most recently added)
- checkForNewLeadAndShowToast() - Detects new leads
- undoAndEditLead(_:) - Handles deletion & modal reopen
- Uses ImportedContact to pass data back to AddLeadView
```

await loadCustomers();
setTimeout(() => setSuccess(''), 3000);
```
