# Build Fix Applied âœ…

## Issue
Xcode couldn't find `SplashScreenView` during compilation:
```
error: cannot find 'SplashScreenView' in scope
```

## Root Cause
The `SplashScreenView.swift` file was created but wasn't added to the Xcode project target. Xcode requires files to be explicitly added to the `project.pbxproj` file to be included in the build.

## Solution Applied
Added `SplashScreenView.swift` to the Xcode project by updating `TrusendaCRM.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj`:

### Changes Made:
1. âœ… Added `PBXBuildFile` entry (line 34)
2. âœ… Added `PBXFileReference` entry (line 44)
3. âœ… Added to `ONBOARDINGGROUP` children (line 203)
4. âœ… Added to `PBXSourcesBuildPhase` (line 339)

## Verification
```bash
# File exists:
TrusendaCRM/Features/Onboarding/SplashScreenView.swift âœ…

# Added to project:
- Build File: SPLASH001 âœ…
- File Reference: SPLASHFILE âœ…
- Group: ONBOARDINGGROUP âœ…
- Sources Phase: SPLASH001 âœ…
```

## Next Steps
1. **Clean Build Folder**: In Xcode, press `Shift + Cmd + K`
2. **Build**: Press `Cmd + B` or `Cmd + R`
3. **Result**: Should build successfully with no errors âœ…

## Technical Notes
- Xcode project files use UUIDs internally, but this project uses descriptive identifiers
- Files must be in 4 places: BuildFile, FileReference, Group, and SourcesBuildPhase
- File path is relative to the project root

## Status
**Build Error**: âœ… FIXED  
**Ready to Build**: âœ… YES  
**Logo Implementation**: âœ… COMPLETE
