✅ DELETE /customers/{id}       - Delete lead
✅ GET  /me                     - Get user info
✅ GET  /tenant-info            - Get branding/plan
✅ POST /update-branding        - Update logo/theme
✅ POST /create-checkout-session - Stripe upgrade
✅ GET  /public-form-manage     - Get public form

## 🎨 UI/UX Consistency

### Design Language
- **Cloud**: Professional, Salesforce-inspired
- **iOS**: Salesforce-Apple hybrid (premium, native)
- **Colors**: Matching Trusenda blue (#0066CC)
- **Typography**: San Francisco (iOS native)
- **Spacing**: Consistent 16px/24px rhythm

### Key Differences (Intentional)
1. **iOS uses native components** (SF Symbols, UIKit elements)
2. **iOS has pull-to-refresh** (native gesture)
3. **iOS has haptic feedback** (touch response)
4. **iOS has splash screen** (branding moment)
5. **iOS has contact import** (native API integration)

These differences enhance iOS while maintaining functional parity.

## 🔍 Code Comparison

### State Management

**Cloud (React)**:
```javascript
const [customers, setCustomers] = useState([]);
const [filters, setFilters] = useState({});
const [followUpCount, setFollowUpCount] = useState(0);
```

**iOS (SwiftUI)**:
```swift
@Published var leads: [Lead] = []
@Published var filteredLeads: [Lead] = []
@Published var followUpCount: Int = 0
```

### API Calls

**Cloud (React)**:
```javascript
const response = await API.listCustomers();
const data = response.customers || [];
setCustomers(data);
```

**iOS (Swift)**:
```swift
let response: LeadsResponse = try await client.get(endpoint: .customers)
leads = response.customers
```

### Follow-Up Logic

Both apps use identical date comparison:

**Cloud**:
```javascript
const isDue = followUpOn && new Date(followUpOn) <= new Date();
```

**iOS**:
```swift
var isFollowUpDue: Bool {
    guard let followUpDate = followUpOn else { return false }
    return followUpDate <= Calendar.current.startOfDay(for: Date())
}
```

|--------|-------|-----|--------|
| **Auth Flow** | Netlify Widget | REST API | No widget SDK for iOS |
| **Stripe Checkout** | Redirect | SFSafariViewController | Native web view |
| **File Upload** | Web input | DocumentPicker | Native file access |

## 📈 Performance Comparison

| Metric | Cloud Web | iOS Native |
|--------|-----------|------------|
| **Initial Load** | 1-2s | 0.5-1s |
| **Lead List Render** | 500ms | 200ms |
