# Move Timeline Logic - Fixed to Be Intuitive

## ‚úÖ Problem Fixed

**Issue:** Timeline dates could be in the PAST when lead just added (confusing!)

**Example Problem:**
- Lead added: Oct 21, 2025
- Selected: "Immediate (This Month)"
- Calculated: Move 10/25 - 10/25 (October month start)
- Result: "Was: 10/25 - 20d past" ‚ùå NONSENSE!

**The lead was just created, how can move date be 20 days ago?!**

---

## ‚úÖ New Logic (Intuitive & Forward-Looking)

**ALL timelines now calculate from TODAY forward:**

### Immediate = Next 7 Days
**Before:** "This Month" (could be past if late in month)  
**After:** "Next 7 days" from TODAY

**Example:**
- Lead added: Oct 21
- Select: "Immediate"
- Calculates: 10/21 - 10/28 (today + 7 days)
- Shows: "Move: 10/21 - 10/28 (in 7d)" ‚úÖ

**Meaning:** They need space ASAP, within the next week

### 1-3 Months = 1-3 Months from TODAY
**Before:** From start of next month  
**After:** From TODAY + 1 month to TODAY + 3 months

**Example:**
- Lead added: Oct 21
- Select: "1-3 Months"
- Calculates: 11/21 - 01/21
- Shows: "Move: 11/21 - 01/21 (31d out)" ‚úÖ

### All Other Timelines
- **3-6 Months:** TODAY + 3mo to TODAY + 6mo
- **6-12 Months:** TODAY + 6mo to TODAY + 12mo
- **12+ Months:** TODAY + 12mo to TODAY + 18mo
- **Flexible:** No dates

**Result:** ALWAYS forward-looking, never in the past ‚úÖ

## üìä Timeline Calculation Logic

### Status Categories (matches cloud):

**Immediate (0-30 days):**
- Move date within 30 days from today
- Urgent attention needed
- Example: 7 days out

**Heating Up (31-90 days):**
- Move date 1-3 months away
- Active engagement needed
- Example: 74 days out

**Upcoming (90+ days):**
- Move date 3+ months away
- Early stage, monitor
- Example: 120 days out

**Overdue (negative days):**
- Move date has passed
- Immediate action required
- Example: Should have moved 5 days ago

## üéØ What "Immediate" Now Means

**Clear Definition:**
- "I need space within the next 7 days"
- Calculated from: TODAY
- Shows: Actual dates (10/21 - 10/28)
- Days count: "in 7d" or less

**User Experience:**
- Sales lead comes in saying "I need space IMMEDIATELY"
- You select: "Immediate (Next 7 days)"
- System calculates: Today through next week
- Timeline shows: "Move: 10/21 - 10/28 (in 7d)"
- **Makes sense!** ‚úÖ

## üìã Complete Timeline Options

| Option | Meaning | Calculation | Example |
|--------|---------|-------------|---------|
| Immediate (Next 7 days) | ASAP | TODAY + 7d | 10/21 - 10/28 |
| 1-3 Months Out | Soon | TODAY + 1-3mo | 11/21 - 01/21 |
| 3-6 Months Out | Planning | TODAY + 3-6mo | 01/21 - 04/21 |
| 6-12 Months Out | Future | TODAY + 6-12mo | 04/21 - 10/21 |
| 12+ Months Out | Long-term | TODAY + 12-18mo | 10/21 - 04/22 |
| Flexible / TBD | Unknown | No dates | ‚Äî |

**All make sense chronologically!** ‚úÖ

## üîß What I Changed

**File:** `AddLeadView.swift`

**Old Logic:**
```swift
// Immediate (this month)
let thisMonth = calendar.date(from: calendar.dateComponents([.year, .month], from: now))!
// Problem: If today is Oct 21, thisMonth = Oct 1 (20 days ago!)
```

**New Logic:**
```swift
// Immediate = next 7 days from TODAY
let immediateStart = now // TODAY
let immediateEnd = calendar.date(byAdding: .day, value: 7, to: now)!
// Result: Always forward-looking ‚úÖ
```

**All options now use:**
- `.date(byAdding: .month, value: X, to: NOW)`
- Always from current date
- Always forward-looking
- Never in the past

## ‚úÖ Timeline Labels Updated

**More Intuitive Labels:**
- "Immediate (Next 7 days)" - Clear timeframe
- "1-3 Months Out" - Forward-looking language
- "3-6 Months Out" - Clear it's from now
- "6-12 Months Out" - Future-facing
- "12+ Months Out" - Long-term
- "Flexible / TBD" - No commitment

**Old labels like "1-3 Months" were ambiguous** - from when?  
**New labels clarify** - from TODAY ‚úÖ

## üí° Why This Makes Sense

**Sales Scenario:**
- Customer calls: "I need warehouse space IMMEDIATELY"

**All timeline options are now:**
- ‚úÖ Forward-looking (from today)
- ‚úÖ Never in the past
- ‚úÖ Clear what they mean
- ‚úÖ Match user expectations

**Files Modified:**
- `AddLeadView.swift` - Timeline calculation logic
