## 🎯 What You Got (All Working Now!)

### 1. **Professional Green Validation** ✅
All form fields show clear **Salesforce green** indicators when properly filled:

- **Property Title** → GREEN when typed
- **Street Address** → GREEN when typed  
- **City** → GREEN when typed
- **State** → GREEN when typed (2 letters, auto-uppercase)
- **ZIP Code** → GREEN when valid 5 digits
- **Property Type** → GREEN when selected
- **Size Range** → GREEN when selected
- **Price Range** → GREEN when selected
- **Best Suited For** → GREEN when selected
- **Photos** → GREEN when at least 1 loaded

**Empty fields** → Red indicators  
**Filled fields** → **Green indicators** ✅

### 2. **Required Property Photos** ✅
Properties must have at least one photo:
- Quality control for all listings
- Professional appearance
- Better lead engagement

### 3. **Manual Address Entry** ✅
Traditional text input fields - **no external APIs, no costs!**
- Street Address field
- City field
- State field (auto-uppercase)
- ZIP code field (validates 5 digits)

## 🔍 Debugging Guide

### If Field Stays Red After Filling

**Property Title**
```
Issue: Still red after typing
Fix: Make sure you actually typed text (not just focused field)
```

**Street Address**
```
Issue: Still red after typing
Fix: Type actual address text
```

**City/State**
```
Issue: Still red after typing
Fix: Type actual city/state
State: Use 2-letter code (FL, CA, NY, etc.)
```

**ZIP Code**
```
Issue: Still red after typing
Fix: Must be exactly 5 digits (e.g., 33401)
Not: 12345-6789 or 1234 or ABC
```

**Pickers (Type/Size/Price/Industry)**
```
Issue: Still red after opening
Fix: Actually SELECT an option (don't just tap outside)
```

**Photos**
```
Issue: Still red after opening picker
Fix: Actually SELECT photos (wait for thumbnails to appear)
```
