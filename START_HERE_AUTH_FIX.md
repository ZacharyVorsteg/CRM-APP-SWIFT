# 🚀 START HERE - Authentication Persistence Fix

**Date:** October 22, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE & READY TO TEST  

---

## ⚡ TL;DR (Too Long; Didn't Read)

**Your app kept logging you out. That's now fixed.**

**Test it:**
1. Login to the app
2. Close the app completely
3. Reopen the app
4. **You should NOT see the login screen** ✅

---

## 🎯 What Was Fixed

### Before ❌
- App logged you out every time you reopened it
- Had to enter credentials repeatedly
- Frustrating user experience

### After ✅
- App keeps you logged in indefinitely
- Only see login screen on first launch or after manual logout
- Automatic token refresh in background
- Smooth, professional experience

---

## 🧪 Quick Test (30 seconds)

```
1. Open app and login
2. Close app (swipe up in app switcher)
3. Reopen app
4. Expected: Splash screen → Main app (NO login)
```

**If you see the login screen = BUG (report immediately)**  
**If you see splash then main app = SUCCESS** ✅

---

## 📱 What You'll See Now

### First Time User
```
Install App → Login Screen → Enter Credentials → 
Splash Screen → Welcome Tour → Main App
```

### Returning User (Every Time You Open App)
```
Open App → Splash Screen → Main App
(NO login screen!)
```

### After Manual Logout
```
Settings → Logout → Login Screen
(Expected behavior)
```

## ✅ Deployment Checklist

Before deploying:

**Required Tests:**
- [ ] Test immediate app reopen (should NOT show login)
- [ ] Test app reopen after 2+ hours (should auto-refresh token)
- [ ] Test manual logout (should show login)
- [ ] Test on real iOS device (not just simulator)

**Optional Tests:**
- [ ] Test device restart (should persist session)
- [ ] Test network interruption (should handle gracefully)
- [ ] Review debug logs in Xcode console

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### "I still see the login screen on reopen"

**Check:**
1. Did you actually login successfully?
2. Did you manually logout before closing app?
3. Are you testing on a real device or simulator?
4. Check Xcode console logs - what do they say?

**Debug Logs Should Show:**
```
🔐 Found stored tokens - initializing as authenticated
✅ Session restored successfully
```

### "App crashes on reopen"

**Check:**
1. Xcode console for crash logs
2. Verify keychain permissions
3. Test with fresh app install

### "Token refresh fails"

**Check:**
1. Is device connected to internet?
2. Is backend working? (test cloud app)
3. Has refresh token expired? (30 days)
