# Settings View - Final Clean Version

The app now uses **CleanSettingsView.swift** exclusively.

## What Was Removed:
- ❌ EnhancedSettingsView (had conflicting tabs)
- ❌ Old SettingsView (basic version)

## What's Active:
- ✅ **CleanSettingsView.swift** - Single, stable view

## Structure:
1. **Account** - Plan, email, lead usage
2. **Public Form** - Copy/share link (hero element)
3. **Billing** - Upgrade OR manage subscription
4. **Account Management** - Password, export, support, sign out, delete

## No More Flickering:
- Single view, no conflicts
- Fetches data once on appear
- Stable, professional experience

The rotating/transforming issue is now fixed.
