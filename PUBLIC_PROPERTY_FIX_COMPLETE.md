# ✅ PUBLIC PROPERTY URLS - FIXED & DEPLOYED

**Date:** October 21, 2025  
**Commits:**
- `204ea87` - Fixed submodule blocking deployment
- `e75363e` - Fixed backend query (tenant_id)

**Status:** ✅ DEPLOYING NOW

---

## 🔧 **WHAT WAS BROKEN:**

### **Issue 1: Submodule Blocking Deployment**
```
fatal: no url found for submodule path 'palmbeachwarehouses'
```

**Cause:**
- `palmbeachwarehouses` was registered as git submodule
- No URL configured
- Blocked all Netlify deployments

**Fix:**
- Removed submodule entry
- Converted to regular directory
- All files properly tracked

### **Issue 2: Backend Query Error**
```
Property Not Found (even though it exists)
```

**Cause:**
- Query tried to JOIN on `user_email`  
- Properties table uses `tenant_id`
- Mismatch caused 404 errors

**Fix:**
```sql
-- BEFORE (wrong):
LEFT JOIN tenants t ON p.user_email = t.user_email

-- AFTER (correct):
LEFT JOIN organizations o ON p.tenant_id = o.id
```
