## 🔔 Push Notifications Implementation

### Capabilities:
```swift
- Requests authorization: [.alert, .badge, .sound]
- Registers for remote notifications with APNs
- Checks authorization status on view appear
- Handles permission denied gracefully
```

### Integration Points:
```swift
// Request permission
UNUserNotificationCenter.current().requestAuthorization(...)

// Register with APNs
UIApplication.shared.registerForRemoteNotifications()

// Check status
notificationSettings().authorizationStatus
```

### What Users Get:
- Follow-up reminders pushed to device
- New lead alert badges
- Sound notifications
- Lock screen notifications
- Banner notifications

---

## 📧 Email vs Push Notifications

### Email (Resend):
- ✅ New lead captures (instant)
- ✅ Daily follow-up digest (7:00 AM)
- ✅ Account alerts (billing, limits)
- ✅ Can be toggled off
- ✅ Sent via Resend API

### iOS Push (APNs):
- ✅ Real-time follow-up reminders
- ✅ New lead instant alerts
- ✅ Badge count for due items
- ✅ Native iOS experience
- ✅ Can be toggled off
- ✅ Requires iOS permission

### Why Both?
- Email: Permanent record, accessible anywhere
- Push: Instant, on-device, better engagement
- User choice: Toggle either/both based on preference

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Permission Handling:
```swift
func requestPushNotificationPermission() {
    UNUserNotificationCenter.current()
        .requestAuthorization(options: [.alert, .badge, .sound]) { granted, _ in
            if granted {
                UIApplication.shared.registerForRemoteNotifications()
            }
        }
}
```

### Status Checking:
```swift
func checkPushNotificationStatus() async {
    let settings = await UNUserNotificationCenter.current()
        .notificationSettings()
    pushNotificationsAuthorized = settings.authorizationStatus == .authorized
}
```

### Email Preference:
```swift
func updateEmailPreference(_ enabled: Bool) async {
    UserDefaults.standard.set(enabled, forKey: "email_notifications_enabled")
    // Future: POST to API endpoint
}
```

---

## 🎯 Future Backend Integration

### Suggested API Endpoint:
```
POST /.netlify/functions/update-notification-preferences
Body: {
  "emailEnabled": true,
  "pushEnabled": true,
  "pushToken": "apns_device_token..."
}
```

### What Backend Needs:
1. Store user's push notification preference
2. Store APNs device token
3. Send push notifications via APNs when:
   - New lead captured
   - Follow-up due today
   - Account alert (billing, limits)
