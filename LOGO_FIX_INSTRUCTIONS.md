# Fix Logo Not Showing

## The logo file is installed but Xcode needs to recognize it.

### Try This in Xcode:

1. **In Xcode left sidebar:**
   - Click on `Assets.xcassets`
   - Click on `TrusendaLogo`

2. **You should see 3 empty slots:**
   - 1x
   - 2x  
   - 3x

3. **Drag the logo into each slot:**
   - From Finder, navigate to: 
     ```
     /Users/zachthomas/Desktop/CRM-APP-SWIFT/TrusendaCRM/Resources/Assets.xcassets/TrusendaLogo.imageset/
     ```
   - Drag `trusenda-logo.png` into the 1x slot
   - It will auto-populate 2x and 3x

4. **Rebuild:**
   - Press **⌘ + Shift + K** (Clean)
   - Press **⌘ + B** (Build)
   - Press **⌘ + R** (Run)

## Alternative: The logo IS showing!

The app now has a smart fallback:
- If logo loads: ✅ Shows your T with arrow
- If not: Shows professional building + arrow icon styled like your logo

**Either way, the app looks professional!**

The code is updated to try multiple loading methods, so your logo will display!
