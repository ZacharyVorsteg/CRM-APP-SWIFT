## 🎯 How It Works

### Adding a Property:
1. Tap **Properties** tab (2nd tab)
2. Tap **+** button
3. Fill property details:
   - Title: "5,000 SF Industrial Warehouse"
   - Location: "West Palm Beach, FL"
   - Property Type: "Warehouse" (dropdown)
   - Transaction: "Lease" (dropdown)
   - Size: "2,500 - 5,000 SF" (dropdown)
   - Price: "$5,000 - $10,000/mo" (dropdown)
4. Tap **"Add Property"**

**Backend automatically:**
- Saves to PostgreSQL database
- Compares with ALL your leads
- Calculates match scores
- Returns top 5 matches

**You see:**
- Property appears in grid
- If matches found, see match notification

### Viewing Matches:
**Option 1:** Tap property → Detail view → "MATCHED LEADS" section  
**Option 2:** Long press property → Instant matches popup

## 🧠 Intelligent Matching

### Match Scoring (100 points):
- 🏢 **Property Type:** 30 pts (Warehouse = Warehouse)
- 📝 **Transaction:** 20 pts (Lease = Lease)
- 📐 **Size Range:** 25 pts (overlap detection)
- 🏭 **Industry:** 15 pts (Manufacturing = Manufacturing)
- 📍 **Location:** 10 pts (City matching)

**Meaningful Match:** 50+ points

### Example Match:
```
Property: "5,000 SF Warehouse - West Palm Beach"
         ↓
Lead (Jim): Needs Warehouse, 2,500 SF, West Palm Beach
         ↓
Score: 95 points 🟢 "Excellent Match"
Reasons:
- ✓ Property type matches
- ✓ Size range matches  
- ✓ Location matches
- ✓ Transaction matches
```

**Notification:** "Jim might be a good fit for 5,000 SF Warehouse"

## ✅ What Was Fixed

**Build Errors Corrected:**
- ✅ Changed `KeychainManager.getToken()` → Uses `APIClient` pattern
- ✅ Changed `Endpoints.baseURL` → `Endpoint` enum cases
- ✅ Fixed `NetworkError.invalidResponse` → Not needed with APIClient
- ✅ Fixed `NetworkError.serverError()` → Uses 2 parameters
- ✅ Used `apiClient.get/post/put/delete` methods (matches LeadViewModel)

**Result:** Clean build, no errors! ✅
