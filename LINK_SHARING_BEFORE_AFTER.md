## Code Comparison

### BEFORE

```swift
private func shareFormLink(_ urlString: String) {
    guard let url = URL(string: urlString) else { return }
    
    guard url.scheme == "https" || url.scheme == "http" else { return }
    
    let shareText = "Submit leads to my CRM: \(urlString)"
    let activityItems: [Any] = [shareText, url]  // ❌ Text first
    
    let activityViewController = UIActivityViewController(
        activityItems: activityItems,
        applicationActivities: nil
    )
    
    // No completion handler ❌
    // No excluded activities ❌
    // No detailed logging ❌
    // No host validation ❌
    
    rootViewController.present(activityViewController, animated: true)
}
```

### AFTER

```swift
private func shareFormLink(_ urlString: String) {
    guard let url = URL(string: urlString) else { return }
    
    // ✅ Validates both scheme AND host
    guard url.scheme == "https" || url.scheme == "http",
          url.host != nil else { return }
    
    // ✅ Better message
    let shareText = "Fill out my commercial real estate lead form: \(urlString)"
    let activityItems: [Any] = [url, shareText]  // ✅ URL first
    
    let activityViewController = UIActivityViewController(
        activityItems: activityItems,
        applicationActivities: nil
    )
    
    // ✅ Exclude incompatible activities
    activityViewController.excludedActivityTypes = [
        .assignToContact,
        .saveToCameraRoll,
        .addToReadingList,
        .postToFlickr,
        .postToVimeo
    ]
    
    // ✅ Success/error feedback
    activityViewController.completionWithItemsHandler = { type, completed, items, error in
        if let error = error {
            print("❌ Share failed: \(error)")
            // Show error message
        } else if completed {
            print("✅ Shared via \(type?.rawValue ?? "unknown")")
            // Show success message
        }
    }
    
    // ✅ Detailed logging
    print("🔗 Preparing to share: \(urlString)")
    print("🔗 URL components - Scheme: \(url.scheme), Host: \(url.host), Path: \(url.path)")
    
    rootViewController.present(activityViewController, animated: true) {
