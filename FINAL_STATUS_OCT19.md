## 🔴 Critical Timezone Fix

**THE BUG:**
```
Schedule tomorrow (Oct 20) → Shows as "TODAY" ❌
```

**THE CAUSE:**
- iOS parsed UTC timestamps for DATE values
- Oct 20 00:00 UTC = Oct 19 19:00 EST
- Caused 1-day shift in non-UTC timezones

**THE FIX:**
- Changed 2 timezone references: UTC → LOCAL
- Extract date portion, ignore timezone suffix
- Parse as local calendar date
- Works in ALL timezones now ✅

**FILES:**
- `Lead.swift` (parsing from API)
- `DateFormatter+Extensions.swift` (formatting to API)

## 💡 The Learning

### Key Insight:
**PostgreSQL DATE ≠ UTC Timestamp**

When backend has:
```sql
follow_up_on DATE
```

This is a **calendar date**, not a **moment in time**.

**Correct handling:**
- Extract date portion: "2025-10-20"
- Parse in user's timezone
- Compare in user's timezone
- Keep date consistent

**Wrong handling (old code):**
- Parse full UTC timestamp
- Convert to local time
- Causes date shift
- Oct 20 becomes Oct 19 in some zones

---

## 🎯 Impact

### Who Was Affected:
- ❌ Anyone NOT in UTC timezone
- ❌ US users (EST, PST, CST, MST)
- ❌ Asian users (JST, etc.)
- ✅ UK users in UTC were fine

### How It Manifested:
- Tomorrow showed as "Today"
- Follow-ups appeared 1 day early
- Badge counts wrong
- Confusing user experience

### Now Fixed For:
- ✅ ALL worldwide timezones
- ✅ All US timezones
- ✅ All international timezones
- ✅ Universal compatibility

---

## 🔧 Technical Summary

### Root Cause:
Using UTC timezone for DATE values (calendar dates)

### Proper Solution:
Use local timezone for DATE values (what we did)

### Why It Works:
- Backend DATE column = calendar date concept
- User's local timezone = same calendar date concept
- Matching semantics = correct behavior

## 📝 Build Checklist

Before testing, ensure:

1. ✅ Stop current app instance (⌘.)
2. ✅ Clean build folder (⌘⇧K)
3. ✅ Build succeeds (⌘B)
4. ✅ Run on simulator (⌘R)

**Then test:**

5. ✅ Schedule for tomorrow
6. ✅ Verify NOT in Follow-Ups tab
7. ✅ Check console (should be clean)
8. ✅ Check dates show relatively

**If step 6 passes (tomorrow is not TODAY) → Success!** 🎉
