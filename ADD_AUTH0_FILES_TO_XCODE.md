# 🔧 Fix Build Error - Add Auth0 Files to Xcode

**Error:** `Cannot find 'Auth0Config' in scope`

**Cause:** New Auth0 files haven't been added to the Xcode project yet.

---

## 🚀 Quick Fix (2 Minutes)

### Option 1: Build Without Auth0 (Recommended for Now)

The app will work perfectly with Netlify Identity until you're ready to enable Auth0.

**To fix the build immediately:**

The APIClient.swift is already updated with conditional compilation. The build should work now!

Just **rebuild** in Xcode:
1. Clean build folder: **Cmd+Shift+K**
2. Build: **Cmd+B**
3. Run: **Cmd+R**

The app will use Netlify Identity (which is working) until Auth0 package is installed.

### Option 2: Full Auth0 Integration (10 Minutes)

When you're ready to enable Auth0:

#### Step 1: Install Auth0.swift Package (3 minutes)

1. Open Xcode
2. **File → Add Package Dependencies**
3. Enter URL: `https://github.com/auth0/Auth0.swift`
4. Version: **Up to Next Major Version** (3.0.0)
5. Click **"Add Package"**
6. Select target: **TrusendaCRM**
7. Click **"Add Package"**

#### Step 2: Add Auth0 Files to Xcode Project (2 minutes)

1. In Xcode, right-click on **TrusendaCRM/Core/Network** folder
2. Select **"Add Files to TrusendaCRM..."**
3. Navigate to: `/Users/zachthomas/Desktop/CRM-APP-SWIFT/TrusendaCRM/Core/Network/`
4. Select these files:
   - `Auth0Config.swift`
   - `Auth0Manager.swift`
5. Make sure **"Copy items if needed"** is UNCHECKED (files are already in correct location)
6. Make sure **"Create groups"** is selected
7. Make sure **TrusendaCRM** target is checked
8. Click **"Add"**

#### Step 3: Add Import Statement (1 minute)

Open `APIClient.swift` and add at the top (after `import Foundation`):

```swift
#if canImport(Auth0)
import Auth0
#endif
```

#### Step 4: Build and Test (2 minutes)

1. Clean build folder: **Cmd+Shift+K**
2. Build: **Cmd+B**
3. Run: **Cmd+R**
4. Check console for:
   ```

**Your app is configured to work either way:**

### Without Auth0 Package (Current):
- ✅ App builds and runs
- ✅ Uses Netlify Identity (working perfectly)
- ✅ All features functional
- ⏹️ No social logins yet

### With Auth0 Package (After adding):
- ✅ App builds and runs
- ✅ Uses Auth0 for authentication
- ✅ Google & Apple social logins available
- ✅ Automatic fallback to Netlify still works

## 🎯 Recommended Approach

**For Now:**
1. Build with Netlify Identity (works immediately)
2. Deploy cloud app with Auth0
3. Test cloud app Google login
4. Then add Auth0 to iOS when ready

**Later:**
1. Follow Option 2 above
2. Install Auth0.swift package
3. Add files to Xcode project
4. Test iOS social logins

---

## 🔍 Verify Build Works

After cleaning and rebuilding:

**Console should show:**
```
🔐 Using Netlify Identity token
🔐 Netlify token obtained
```

**App should:**
- ✅ Build successfully
- ✅ Run without errors
- ✅ Login with email/password works
- ✅ All CRM features work

## 📱 When You're Ready for Auth0 on iOS

Follow **Option 2** above to:
1. Install Auth0.swift package
2. Add Auth0Config.swift and Auth0Manager.swift to project
3. Rebuild
4. Test social logins

The code is already written and ready - just needs to be added to the Xcode project!
