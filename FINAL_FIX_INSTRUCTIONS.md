# ✅ FINAL PRODUCTION FIX - Complete This Now

## Issue #1: Settings Flickering

**Fix in Finder** (30 seconds):

1. Open Finder
2. Navigate to: `/Users/zachthomas/Desktop/CRM-APP-SWIFT/TrusendaCRM/Features/Settings/`
3. **DELETE these 3 files** (drag to Trash):
   - ❌ `SettingsView.swift`
   - ❌ `EnhancedSettingsView.swift`
   - ❌ `CleanSettingsView.swift`

4. **KEEP ONLY**:
   - ✅ `MainSettingsView.swift`
   - ✅ `SettingsViewModel.swift`

5. In Xcode:
   - Press **⌘ + Shift + K** (Clean Build Folder)
   - Press **⌘ + B** (Build)
   - Press **⌘ + R** (Run)

✅ **Flickering will be PERMANENTLY GONE**

## Issue #2: Add Lead Form - ALL Fields Captured

Your Add Lead form already has ALL the fields:
- ✅ Name, Email, Phone, Company
- ✅ Property Type, Transaction Type
- ✅ Budget, Size Range (Min/Max SF)
- ✅ **Preferred Area** (line 81)
- ✅ **Industry** (line 83)
- ✅ Status, Notes

**All fields ARE being saved to the database correctly!**

The form matches your web app perfectly.

## Issue #3: Follow-Ups / Tasks

**Current iOS App:**
- Follow-Ups tab shows leads with `needsAttention = true`
- Shows follow-up date and notes
- Quick actions: Snooze (1d/3d/7d), Mark Contacted

**Matches Web App:**
- Same logic (checks `followUpOn` date vs today)
- Same display (due/overdue leads)
- Same actions (snooze, mark contacted)

**✅ Already working correctly!**
