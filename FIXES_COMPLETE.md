# âœ… All Issues Fixed!

## What Was Fixed:

### 1. TenantInfo Decoding Error âœ…
**Problem**: Backend returns `null` for `autoTailor` and `headerTheme` when not set  
**Solution**: Made these fields optional in Swift model

**Before:**
```swift
let autoTailor: Bool
let headerTheme: String
```

**After:**
```swift
let autoTailor: Bool?  // Optional
let headerTheme: String?  // Optional
```

**Result**: âœ… Settings screen loads without errors!

---

### 2. Pull-to-Refresh Added âœ…
**Added swipe-down refresh to:**
- âœ… **Leads tab** (already had it)
- âœ… **Follow-Ups tab** (now added)
- âœ… **Settings tab** (now added)

**How it works:**
- Swipe down on any list
- Refreshes data from backend
- Shows loading indicator
- Updates instantly

---

### 3. Branding Enhanced âœ…
**Login & Signup screens now show:**
- âœ… Trusenda logo with rounded corners (white background)
- âœ… **"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL REAL ESTATE CRM"** in teal
- âœ… **"Built by Realtors, for Realtors"** tagline
- âœ… Professional gradient background
- âœ… Matches web app branding

## Harmless Warnings (Can Ignore):

These are iOS Simulator warnings that don't affect functionality:

- `load_eligibility_plist` - Simulator entitlements (harmless)
- `nw_connection` - Network connection logging (harmless)
- `CA Event` - Analytics events (harmless)

**They don't appear in production builds on real devices.**
