# Login Timeout Troubleshooting

## Issue: Request Timeout

You're getting: **"The request timed out"** when trying to login.

**Error Code:** -1001 (NSURLErrorDomain)

---

## ✅ What I Fixed

### 1. App Transport Security ✅
- Added proper HTTPS configuration for trusenda.com
- Allows secure connections to your backend

### 2. Timeout Increased ✅
- Changed from default (60s) to explicit 30s
- Added debug logging to see what's happening

---

## 🔍 Possible Causes

### Most Likely: Network Connectivity

**Check on your iPhone:**

1. **WiFi Connected?**
   - Settings → WiFi → Connected?
   - Try switching to Cellular data

2. **Can you browse websites?**
   - Open Safari on iPhone
   - Go to https://trusenda.com
   - Does it load?

3. **Firewall/VPN?**
   - Disable any VPN temporarily
   - Try on different network

### Test the Endpoint Directly:

**On your Mac, run this:**
```bash
curl -X POST https://trusenda.com/.netlify/identity/token \
  -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
  -d "grant_type=password&username=zacharyvorsteg@gmail.com&password=YOUR_PASSWORD"
```

**If this works:** Network is fine, issue is in app  
**If this fails:** Backend or network problem

## 🔧 Quick Fixes to Try

### Fix 1: Check iPhone Network

**On iPhone:**
1. Settings → WiFi → Make sure connected
2. Safari → Go to https://trusenda.com
3. Should load your CRM site

### Fix 2: Check Console for Errors

**In Xcode console, you should now see:**
```
🌐 Attempting login to: https://trusenda.com/.netlify/identity/token
📧 Email: zacharyvorsteg@gmail.com
```

**If you see that, the request is being sent.**

**Then you should see:**
```
✅ Network response received
✅ Login successful! Token expires in 3600 seconds
```

**OR an error like:**
```
❌ Login error (401): Invalid credentials
```

## 🚀 Try This Now

2. **Build** (⌘B)
3. **Run** (⌘R)
4. **Enter credentials**
5. **Watch console** for the new log messages

**The console will tell us exactly what's happening!**
