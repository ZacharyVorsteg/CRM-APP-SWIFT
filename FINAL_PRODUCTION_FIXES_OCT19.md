# ✅ Final Production Fixes - October 19, 2025

## All Issues Resolved - App Store Ready! 🚀

---

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Binary Plist Encoding (CRITICAL)
**Problem:** Links shared via Messages showed garbled text: `bplist00%C2%A2%01%02...`  
**Fix:** Share plain text only (not URL objects)  
**Result:** Recipients now see clean, clickable URLs

### 2. ✅ Toast Messages Not Auto-Dismissing
**Problem:** "✅ Link copied to clipboard!" stayed on screen forever  
**Fix:** Added 2.5-second auto-dismiss with smooth animations  
**Result:** Professional, non-intrusive feedback

### 3. ✅ Toast Styling & Positioning
**Problem:** Toast was a plain green rectangle, blocked UI  
**Fix:** Capsule shape with shadow, proper spacing, animations  
**Result:** Modern iOS-style toast that looks professional
