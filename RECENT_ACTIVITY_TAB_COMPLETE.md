# ✅ Recent Activity Tab + UI Fixes - October 21, 2025

## 🎯 What Was Built

### New Feature: Recent Activity Tab
**Location:** Between Follow-Ups and Settings tabs  
**Purpose:** Centralized activity feed showing all CRM actions in clear enterprise language  
**Aesthetic:** Matches Leads tab with card-based design and professional polish

---

## 🎨 UI Fixes Applied

### Fix #1: Gradient Consistency ✅
**Problem:** Follow-Ups empty state tip box had orange gradient, didn't match top circle

**Solution:** Changed tip box to use SAME gradient as top circle
```swift
// BEFORE (Orange gradient)
LinearGradient(
    colors: [Color.orange.opacity(0.15), Color.orange.opacity(0.20)],
    ...
)

// AFTER (Blue-to-Green gradient - matches top)
LinearGradient(
    colors: [Color.primaryBlue.opacity(0.1), Color.successGreen.opacity(0.15)],
    startPoint: .topLeading,
    endPoint: .bottomTrailing
)
```

**Result:** Perfect visual consistency! ✅

---

### Fix #2: Text Contrast ✅
**Problem:** Tip text was hard to read with secondary color

**Solution:**
- Changed from `.secondary` to `.primary` color
- Added `.fontWeight(.medium)` for better readability

**Result:** Much more readable! ✅
