# iOS App Critical Fixes - October 19, 2025

## 🎯 Issues Reported & Resolved

### ❌ Issue #1: Lead Editing Not Saving
**Your Report:** "the ios app when I edit leads changes dont get saved. like in the notes for example"

**Status:** ✅ **FIXED**

**What Was Wrong:**
The iOS app was sending ALL fields (including null values) when updating a lead. The backend would process these null values and potentially overwrite existing data.

**The Fix:**
Added a custom JSON encoder that only sends fields that are actually being changed, not null values for unchanged fields.

**Where:** `TrusendaCRM/Core/Models/Lead.swift` (lines 190-219)

### ❌ Issue #2: Public Form Link Not Working
**Your Report:** "also the public form link when I copy and send it to someone doesnt work like it does for the cloud"

**Status:** ✅ **FIXED**

**What Was Wrong:**
The URL format was correct (`https://trusenda.com/submit/{slug}`), but the iOS app lacked clear testing/debugging tools and user feedback to verify the link worked properly.

**The Fix:**
Enhanced the public form section with:
- Tappable URL that opens directly in Safari
- Improved copy button with better feedback
- New "Test Link in Safari" button for debugging
- Better error handling and logging
- Clear description of what the link does

**Where:** `TrusendaCRM/Features/Settings/SettingsView.swift` (lines 180-264)

✅ Perfect cloud/iOS parity
```

### Public Form Links Now Work Reliably
```
✅ Copy link → Clipboard gets full URL
✅ Share link → Recipients can open in any browser

## 🐛 If Something's Not Working

### Lead Edits Still Not Saving?
1. Check Xcode console for error messages
2. Look for `📝 updateLead()` logs
3. Verify you're logged into the correct account
4. Try editing different fields (status, company)
5. Pull to refresh the leads list

### Form Link Still Not Working?
1. Use the "Test Link in Safari" button
2. Check console for `🔗` and `🧪` logs
3. Verify the slug is not empty
4. Try opening the URL in desktop Safari first
5. Check that you're on the same account as cloud

### Console Shows Errors?
Look for these patterns:
- `❌` = Error occurred (read the message)
- `✅` = Success (operation worked)
- `📋` = Link copied
- `🧪` = Testing link
- `📝` = Updating lead
