# 🔧 Fix "No such module 'Auth0'" - Step by Step

## ✅ CocoaPods Successfully Reinstalled

The pods were just reinstalled successfully:
```
✅ Auth0 (2.15.1)
✅ GooglePlaces (9.4.1)  
✅ JWTDecode (3.3.0)
✅ SimpleKeychain (1.3.0)
```

Now we need to make Xcode recognize them.

## 🔨 FOLLOW THESE EXACT STEPS

### Step 1: Quit Xcode Completely
- **Cmd + Q** to quit (don't just close windows)
- Make sure NO Xcode processes are running

### Step 2: Open Workspace (NOT Project!)
```bash
cd "/Users/zachthomas/Desktop/CRM-APP-SWIFT"
open TrusendaCRM.xcworkspace
```

Or in Finder:
- Navigate to `/Users/zachthomas/Desktop/CRM-APP-SWIFT/`
- Double-click **`TrusendaCRM.xcworkspace`**

### Step 3: Clean Build Folder
In Xcode:
- **Shift + Cmd + K** (Clean Build Folder)
- Wait for it to finish

### Step 4: Build Pods First
In Xcode's top bar, next to the Play/Stop buttons:
1. Click the scheme dropdown (currently says "TrusendaCRM")
2. Select **"Pods-TrusendaCRM"** scheme
3. Press **Cmd + B** to build
4. Wait for "Build Succeeded" ✅

### Step 5: Switch Back and Build App
1. Click the scheme dropdown again
2. Select **"TrusendaCRM"** scheme
3. Press **Cmd + B** to build
4. **It should work!** ✅

## 🎯 Alternative: Build Everything at Once

In Xcode:
1. **Product** menu → **Build For** → **Running**
2. Or just press **Cmd + R** to build and run
3. Xcode will automatically build Pods first, then your app

---

## 🔍 Verify Workspace is Open

Check Xcode's window title - should say:
```
TrusendaCRM - TrusendaCRM.xcworkspace
```

In the left sidebar (Project Navigator), you should see:
```
TrusendaCRM
├── TrusendaCRM (your app)
└── Pods (white folder icon)
    ├── Auth0
    ├── GooglePlaces
    ├── JWTDecode
    └── SimpleKeychain
```

If you don't see "Pods" folder, you're in the WRONG file!

## 🚨 Still Getting Error?

### Option A: Reset Module Cache
In Xcode:
1. **File** menu → **Close Workspace**
2. Delete module cache:
```bash
rm -rf ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData
```
3. Reopen workspace
4. Build

### Option B: Manual Framework Check
1. Select "TrusendaCRM" project in left sidebar (blue icon)
2. Select "TrusendaCRM" target
3. Go to "General" tab
4. Scroll to "Frameworks, Libraries, and Embedded Content"
5. You should see:
   - Auth0.framework
   - GooglePlaces.framework
   - JWTDecode.framework
   - SimpleKeychain.framework

If missing, click **+** and add them from Pods.

## 📝 Build Output to Look For

When building, you should see in the build log:
```
Build target Pods-TrusendaCRM of project Pods with configuration Debug
✓ Build Pods-TrusendaCRM

Build target TrusendaCRM of project TrusendaCRM with configuration Debug  
✓ Compiling LoginView.swift
✓ Compiling AuthManager.swift
...
✓ Build succeeded
```

---

## 🎉 Expected Result

After following these steps:
```
✅ Build succeeded
```

No more "no such module 'Auth0'" error!

## 🔧 Nuclear Option (If Nothing Works)

Close Xcode, then run:

```bash
cd "/Users/zachthomas/Desktop/CRM-APP-SWIFT"

# Remove all build artifacts
rm -rf ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData
rm -rf ~/Library/Caches/CocoaPods
rm -rf Pods/
rm -rf TrusendaCRM.xcworkspace
rm Podfile.lock

# Reinstall everything
pod install

# Open workspace
open TrusendaCRM.xcworkspace
```

Then in Xcode: **Shift + Cmd + K** (clean) → **Cmd + B** (build)

---

**Most likely fix: Just clean build folder (Shift + Cmd + K) and rebuild!**
