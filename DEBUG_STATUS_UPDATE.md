# 🔍 Debugging Status Update Issue

**Date**: October 17, 2025  
**Time**: 8:51 AM PST  
**Status**: 🔍 INVESTIGATING

## 🔴 Issue

**Reported**: 
- Leads disappear after status change  
- "Failed to update status" error appears
- Can't update status at all now

---

## 🔍 Reverse Engineering

### What Should Happen:
```
1. User taps "Cold" badge on "Zachary"
2. Selects "Hot"
3. PUT /customers/{id} with { status: "Hot" }
4. API returns updated lead
5. Local array updates
6. Filters re-apply
7. Lead appears with "Hot" badge
```

### What's Actually Happening:
```
1. User taps badge
2. Selects status
3. API call fails ❌
4. Error toast shows
5. Filter cleared but no update
6. Lead might disappear if it was in filtered view
```

## 🔧 Diagnostic Steps Added

### Enhanced Logging:
```swift
print("🔄 Updating lead \(lead.id) from \(lead.status) to \(newStatus)")
print("✅ Status updated successfully to \(newStatus)")
print("❌ Status update failed: \(error)")
print("❌ Error type: \(type(of: error))")
print("❌ Error details: \(error.localizedDescription)")
```

This will help identify:
- Is the API call being made?
- What exact error is being thrown?
- Is it a network error, auth error, or decode error?

---

## 🎯 Next Steps

Run the app and check console output when toggling status to see:
1. What error is being thrown
2. Why the API call is failing
3. Fix the root cause
