# ✅ Follow-Up System - Simplified Solution

## Build Errors Fixed

**Error:** Swift compiler couldn't type-check complex sheet binding  
**Solution:** Simplified to use existing LeadDetailView for follow-up scheduling  
**Status:** ✅ **READY TO BUILD**

---

## What's Implemented

### 1. ✅ Follow-Ups Tab Shows Full Queue
- Displays ALL scheduled follow-ups (not just due)
- Sorted by date (soonest first)
- Color coded by urgency:
  - 🔴 Red = Overdue
  - 🟠 Orange = Due today
  - ⚪ White = Upcoming

### 2. ✅ Schedule Follow-Ups with Notes
**From Leads List:**
- Swipe LEFT → Tap "Edit"
- Lead detail opens
- Use existing follow-up section
- Set date + enter task notes
- Save

**From Lead Detail:**
- Tap any lead
- Scroll to "FOLLOW-UP" section
- Tap "Reschedule" or tap the date
- Enter task notes
- Set custom date
- Save

**Result:**
- Simpler code (easier to maintain)
