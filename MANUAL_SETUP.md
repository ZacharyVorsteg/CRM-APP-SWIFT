## Troubleshooting

### Error: "Cannot find TrusendaCRMApp in scope"

**Fix**: Make sure `TrusendaCRMApp.swift` exists and has `@main` annotation:

1. Open `TrusendaCRMApp.swift`
2. Verify it contains:
```swift
import SwiftUI

@main
struct TrusendaCRMApp: App {
    @StateObject private var authManager = AuthManager.shared
    
    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            ContentView()
                .environmentObject(authManager)
        }
    }
}
```

### Error: "No such module 'SwiftUI'"

**Fix**: Check deployment target

1. Project settings ‚Üí General tab
2. Set **Minimum Deployments ‚Üí iOS** to **16.0**

### Build errors in Swift files

**Fix**: Clean and rebuild

1. Press **Shift + ‚åò + K** (Clean Build Folder)
2. Press **‚åò + B** (Build)

### Files appear but can't be found during build

**Fix**: Files were added as references instead of groups

1. Select all files in Project Navigator
2. Delete them (don't move to trash, just remove references)
3. Re-add using steps 7-8 above
4. Make sure **"Copy items if needed"** is CHECKED
