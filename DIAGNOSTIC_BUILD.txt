╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

ENHANCED LOGGING ADDED TO:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

✅ Status toggle start (LeadListView)
✅ API request/response (APIClient)
✅ Local array updates (LeadViewModel)
✅ Filter application (LeadViewModel)
✅ Lead counts at each step

BUILD & TEST:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. Product → Build (⌘+B)
2. Product → Run (⌘+R)
3. Open Debug Console (⌘+Shift+Y)

TEST STATUS TOGGLE:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. Tap any status badge
2. Select different status
3. WATCH CONSOLE - You'll see:

🔄 Updating lead {id} from Cold to Warm
📤 PUT https://trusenda.com/...
📦 Body: { "status" : "Warm" }
✅ Status updated successfully to Warm
📝 updateLead() called for ID: {id}
📝 Current leads count: 3
📝 Current statusFilter: none
📥 Response received: {Name} - Warm
📝 Updating local lead at index {n}
📝 Local lead updated: {Name} - Warm
📝 Applying filters...
📝 Leads before filter: 3
📝 Filtered leads after: 3
📝 Displayed leads after: 3

WHAT TO CHECK:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

✅ Does "Filtered leads after" equal total leads?
✅ Does "Displayed leads after" equal filtered leads?
✅ Is statusFilter "none" or is it active?
✅ Does the lead name appear in "Response received"?
✅ Does "Local lead updated" show correct status?

If "Filtered leads after" = 0, that's the problem!
If statusFilter is active, that's why leads disappear!

Copy console output and share it for analysis.
