# Matching Algorithm Redesign - Substantive Criteria

**Date:** October 21, 2025, 3:50 PM  
**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETE & DEPLOYED

---

## üéØ PROBLEM IDENTIFIED

### User Feedback:
> "Just because something is classified as a 'lease' doesn't mean it's a meaningful match. Matching on property type alone is surface-level."

### Issues with Old Algorithm:
1. **Transaction type got 20 points** - Too much weight for basic filter
2. **Industry required exact match** - No umbrella categories
3. **Budget was string comparison** - Not numeric/range-based
4. **Low match threshold (30%)** - Too many weak matches shown

**Example:**
- Hans got 40% match just because:
  - Transaction type matches (Lease) = 20 points
  - Size range matches = 25 points
  - **That's it!** Two criteria = "match"

---

## ‚úÖ NEW ALGORITHM - SUBSTANTIVE CRITERIA

### Redesigned Scoring (100 points total)

**Prioritized by Real-World Importance:**

1. **SIZE MATCH (40 points)** - Most critical factor
   - Perfect fit (property fully contains lead's range) = 40 points
   - Partial overlap = proportional scoring
   - No overlap = 0 points
   
2. **BUDGET MATCH (35 points)** - Second most important
   - Numeric range overlap (e.g., $10K-$20K overlaps $15K-$25K)
   - Proportional scoring based on overlap quality
   - Minimum 50% points for any budget overlap
   
3. **INDUSTRY MATCH (15 points)** - Contextual compatibility
   - Exact match = 15 points
   - Umbrella category match = 12 points
   - No match = 0 points
   
4. **PROPERTY TYPE (5 points)** - Basic filter, low weight
   - Warehouse, Office, Retail, etc.
   - Just a basic requirement, not a meaningful differentiator
   
5. **LOCATION (5 points)** - Nice to have
   - City/area match
   
6. **TRANSACTION TYPE (0 points)** - NOT SCORED
   - Assumed to be pre-filtered
   - Not a meaningful match criterion

### New Match Threshold:
- **Minimum 40% score required** (vs. old 30%)
- **At least 2 criteria must match** (vs. old 1)
- **More stringent = better quality matches**

---

## üè≠ SMART INDUSTRY GROUPING

### Umbrella Categories (Shared Operational Needs)

**1. Industrial/Logistics** (Distribution = Construction = compatible!)
- Construction, Contracting, Distribution, Logistics
- Warehousing, Manufacturing, Wholesale
- **Why grouped:** Similar space needs (warehouse/industrial), logistics access, loading docks, high ceilings

**2. Retail**
- Retail, E-commerce, Consumer Goods, Fashion, Grocery
- **Why grouped:** Foot traffic, display space, accessibility

**3. Food & Beverage**
- Restaurant, Food Service, Catering, Brewery, Food Production
- **Why grouped:** Kitchen facilities, health permits, ventilation

**4. Automotive**
- Automotive, Auto Repair, Auto Body, Auto Parts, Dealership
- **Why grouped:** Bay doors, lift equipment, parts storage

**5. Health & Wellness**
- Healthcare, Medical, Fitness, Spa, Wellness
- **Why grouped:** Specialized facilities, compliance requirements

**6. Technology**
- Technology, Software, IT Services, Data Center, Tech Startup
- **Why grouped:** Power/cooling, security, connectivity

**7. Professional**
- Office, Professional Services, Consulting, Legal, Accounting
- **Why grouped:** Standard office amenities, conference rooms

**8. Creative**
- Creative, Design, Marketing, Advertising, Media
- **Why grouped:** Open layouts, presentation spaces

### How It Works:
```swift
Property: Industrial warehouse
Lead: Construction company

‚úÖ MATCH! Both fall under "Industrial/Logistics" umbrella
Score: 12 points (vs. 0 in old algorithm)
Reason: "Compatible industry (Construction)"
```

---

## üìä COMPARISON: OLD VS. NEW

### Example: Hans - Berlin Autotech (Auto Body Shop)
**Property:** 5,000-10,000 SF Warehouse, $10,000-$20,000/mo, Lease

#### OLD ALGORITHM:
```
‚úÖ Transaction type matches (Lease) = 20 points
‚úÖ Size range matches = 25 points
‚ùå Industry: Auto body ‚â† Warehouse = 0 points
Total: 45/110 = 40%
```

#### NEW ALGORITHM:
```
‚úÖ Size perfect fit = 40 points (property fully contains 2500-5000 SF)
‚úÖ Budget aligned = 35 points (overlaps with $5K-$10K)
‚ùå Industry: Automotive ‚â† Industrial = 0 points*
‚úÖ Property type: Warehouse = 5 points
‚úÖ Location matches = 5 points
Total: 85/100 = 85%

*Note: If property was listed as "Industrial" or "Distribution,"
then umbrella matching would apply!
```

### Key Differences:
1. **Size gets 40 points** (vs. 25) - reflects its true importance
2. **Budget gets 35 points** (vs. 15) - numeric overlap, not string match
3. **Transaction type gets 0 points** (vs. 20) - no longer inflates scores
4. **Industry uses umbrella categories** - recognizes related needs
5. **Higher threshold (40% vs. 30%)** - only meaningful matches shown

## üé® UI IMPROVEMENTS

### Font Legibility Enhanced:
**Before:**
- Company name: `.secondary` color (gray, hard to read)
- Font weight: `.regular`
- Font size: 14px

**After:**
- Company name: `.primary.opacity(0.8)` (darker, more legible)
- Font weight: `.medium` / `.bold`
- Font size: 15px
- Lead name: Bold weight for emphasis

**Affected Views:**
- ‚úÖ PropertiesListView (matched leads sheet)
- ‚úÖ PropertyDetailView (matched leads section)
- ‚úÖ PropertyShareSheet (matched leads preview)

## üì± TESTING CHECKLIST

### Test Size Matching:
- [ ] Lead wants 2,500-5,000 SF
- [ ] Property has 5,000-10,000 SF
- [ ] Should get 40 points (perfect fit)

### Test Budget Matching:
- [ ] Lead budget: $5,000-$10,000/mo
- [ ] Property price: $10,000-$20,000/mo
- [ ] Should get ~17 points (50% overlap)

### Test Industry Grouping:
- [ ] Property: Construction industry
- [ ] Lead: Distribution industry
- [ ] Should get 12 points (umbrella match)

### Test Threshold:
- [ ] Lead matches on size only (40 points) = 40%
- [ ] Should appear as match (meets threshold)
- [ ] Lead matches on location only (5 points) = 5%
- [ ] Should NOT appear (below threshold)

### Test Font Legibility:
- [ ] Company names are readable (darker color)
- [ ] Lead names are bold and prominent
- [ ] Match scores are clearly visible

---

## üöÄ EXPECTED OUTCOMES

### Fewer, Better Matches:
- **Old:** 40% match with 2 weak criteria
- **New:** 85% match with 3 strong criteria

### More Meaningful Connections:
- Properties match based on **actual compatibility**
- Size and budget drive matching, not just "Lease" tag
- Industries with similar needs are recognized

### Better User Experience:
- Higher quality leads see only relevant properties
- Brokers waste less time on poor matches
- Improved conversion rates

## üéØ SUMMARY

### What Changed:
1. ‚úÖ **Reweighted criteria** - Size (40), Budget (35), Industry (15)
2. ‚úÖ **Transaction type removed** - No longer scored
3. ‚úÖ **Smart industry grouping** - 8 umbrella categories
4. ‚úÖ **Numeric budget matching** - Range overlap, not string match
5. ‚úÖ **Higher threshold** - 40% minimum (vs. 30%)
6. ‚úÖ **Better fonts** - Improved legibility across all views

### Result:
**Matches are now based on substantive criteria that actually drive compatibility!**

Build and test to see the difference! üéâ
