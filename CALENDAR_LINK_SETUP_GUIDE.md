# 📅 Calendar Link Setup Guide - Calendly, Google, Outlook

**Critical:** This guide shows you EXACTLY how to get the right calendar booking link for instant tour scheduling.

---

## 🎯 What Link Do You Need?

You need a **publicly bookable calendar link** that:
- ✅ Starts with `https://`
- ✅ Lets anyone book time with you (no login required for them)
- ✅ Works on mobile and desktop
- ✅ Sends you calendar invites automatically

**Your Link:** `https://calendly.com/zvorsteg1` ✅ CORRECT FORMAT!

---

## 📋 Calendly Setup (What You're Using)

### Getting Your Calendly Link:

1. **Go to** https://calendly.com
2. **Log in** to your account
3. **Click "Event Types"** (left sidebar)
4. **Find or create** "Property Tour" or "30 Minute Meeting"
5. **Click on event** → View your booking page
6. **Copy the URL** from browser:
   - ✅ `https://calendly.com/zvorsteg1/30min`
   - ✅ `https://calendly.com/zvorsteg1`
   - ❌ `calendly.com/zvorsteg1` (missing https://)

### Your Current Link: `https://calendly.com/zvorsteg1`

**Status:** ✅ **CORRECT FORMAT!**

The link itself is valid. The 500 error is from the backend not having the database column ready.

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting Your Specific Issue

### Why You're Getting 500 Error:

From the screenshot, I can see:
- ✅ You entered the URL correctly: `https://calendly.com/zvorsteg1`
- ✅ The URL format is valid
- ❌ Backend is throwing "Server error (500)"

**Root Cause:** Backend database doesn't have `calendar_booking_url` column yet.

**The Fix I Just Made:**
1. Added `ensureCalendarColumn()` function to create column automatically
2. Called it BEFORE trying to save your URL
3. Added detailed error logging to see exactly what's failing

---

## 🚀 What to Do Next

### Step 1: Deploy the Fixes

```bash
cd "/Users/zachthomas/Desktop/CRM APP"
git add .
git commit -m "Fix calendar sync: ensure column exists before save"
git push origin main
```

**Wait 1-2 minutes for Netlify to deploy.**

### Step 2: Test Again in iOS App

1. **Close and reopen iOS app** (to get fresh backend connection)
2. **Go to Settings** → Scroll to "INSTANT TOUR BOOKING"
3. **Your URL is already there:** `https://calendly.com/zvorsteg1` ✅
4. **Tap "Save Calendar URL"**
5. **Expected Result:** 
   - ✅ Green success banner: "Calendar URL saved!"
   - ❌ NOT the red 500 error

### Step 3: Verify It Worked

**Check Backend Logs** (Netlify Dashboard):
```
🔧 Ensuring calendar_booking_url column exists...
✅ Calendar booking column ready
📝 Updating calendar URL to: https://calendly.com/zvorsteg1
✅ Calendar booking URL updated for: zacharyvorsteg@gmail.com
   New URL: https://calendly.com/zvorsteg1
```

**If you still get 500 error**, check logs for:
```
🔴 CRITICAL: calendar_booking_url column does not exist!
```

---

## 📱 Alternative: Manual Database Fix (If Auto-Migration Fails)

If the automatic migration doesn't work, you can add the column manually:

```bash
# Connect to your database
psql $DATABASE_URL

# Add the column
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN calendar_booking_url VARCHAR(500);

# Verify it was created
\d users

# You should see:
# calendar_booking_url | character varying(500) |

# Exit
\q
```

Then try saving in iOS app again.

## 🎓 Understanding Calendar Links

### What Makes a Valid Calendar Link:

**✅ VALID Links:**
```
https://calendly.com/zvorsteg1
https://calendly.com/yourname/30min
https://calendly.com/yourname/property-tour
https://calendar.google.com/calendar/appointments/schedules/AcZssZ...
https://outlook.office365.com/owa/calendar/Bookings@company.com/bookings/
https://cal.com/yourname/tour
```

**❌ INVALID Links:**
```
http://calendly.com/...     (http instead of https)
calendly.com/...            (missing https://)
www.calendly.com/...        (missing https://)
calendly.com/zvorsteg1/     (missing https://)
```

### Your Link Analysis:

**Input:** `https://calendly.com/zvorsteg1`

| Check | Status | Result |
|-------|--------|--------|
| Starts with https:// | ✅ | Pass |
| Valid domain | ✅ | Pass (calendly.com) |
| Has user path | ✅ | Pass (zvorsteg1) |
| Format correct | ✅ | Pass |

**Verdict:** Your link is **100% correct!** The error is backend/database, not your link.

## 🎯 Recommended Calendly Setup

To make tour booking work best:

### 1. Create "Property Tour" Event Type

**In Calendly:**
- Name: "Property Tour" or "30 Min Property Showing"
- Duration: 30-60 minutes
- Buffer time: 15 minutes (for travel between properties)
- Location: "I will call the invitee" or "Phone call"

### 2. Add Custom Questions

**Recommended questions to ask when booking:**
- "Which property are you interested in?"
- "What's your budget range?"
- "Preferred move-in timeline?"
- "Any specific requirements?"

### 3. Enable Notifications

**Calendly → Settings → Notifications:**
- ✅ Email confirmations (to you and the lead)
- ✅ Calendar invites
- ✅ SMS reminders (optional, costs extra)

### 4. Sync Your Calendar

**Calendly → Settings → Calendar Connections:**
- Connect Outlook/Google Calendar
- Prevents double-bookings
- Tours appear in your main calendar automatically

## 🆘 If It Still Doesn't Work After Deploy

### Scenario 1: Still Getting 500 Error

**Check Netlify Function Logs:**
1. Go to https://app.netlify.com/sites/trusenda
2. Click "Functions"
3. Click "user-settings"
4. Look for recent errors

**Look For:**
```
🔴 CRITICAL: calendar_booking_url column does not exist!
```

**If you see this:** Run manual database fix (see "Manual Database Fix" above)

### Scenario 2: Save Works, But Calendar Not Showing on Web

**Test Your Calendly Link Directly:**
1. Open Safari
2. Go to: `https://calendly.com/zvorsteg1`
3. Can you see your booking page?
4. If yes → Link is working!
5. If no → Link might be private or deleted

**Make Sure Calendly Event is Public:**
- Calendly → Event Types → Your event
- Settings → "Make this event public"
- Copy the public link

### Scenario 3: Everything Works Except Outlook Integration

**Calendly Already Integrates with Outlook!**
- Calendly → Integrations → Microsoft Outlook
- Connect your Outlook account
- Tours booked via Calendly automatically appear in Outlook
- No additional setup needed

**Or Use Microsoft Bookings Directly:**
- Go to: https://outlook.office365.com/bookings
- Create booking page
- Get your booking link
- Use that instead of Calendly

## 📞 Quick Support Checklist

If calendar sync isn't working:

- [ ] Backend deployed (check Netlify dashboard)
- [ ] iOS app closed and reopened (fresh connection)
- [ ] Using correct link format (`https://calendly.com/...`)
- [ ] Calendly event is public (not private)
- [ ] Internet connection active
- [ ] Logged into iOS app (see Settings shows your email)

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Best Practices:

1. **Use Calendly's mobile app** to manage bookings on the go
2. **Set buffer time** (15-30 min) between tours for travel
3. **Add calendar sync** so tours appear in Outlook/Google automatically
4. **Enable email confirmations** for both you and leads
5. **Add custom questions** to qualify leads before tours
6. **Set availability hours** (e.g., M-F 9am-5pm only)

### Link Organization:

**Multiple Event Types:**
- Property Tour: `https://calendly.com/zvorsteg1/tour`
- Quick Call: `https://calendly.com/zvorsteg1/15min`
- Consultation: `https://calendly.com/zvorsteg1/consult`

**Use Different Links for Different Properties:**
- High-value listings → Longer tour duration
- Quick viewings → Shorter duration
- Virtual tours → Video call instead of in-person
