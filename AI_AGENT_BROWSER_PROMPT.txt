=== AI AGENT PROMPT FOR APP STORE CONNECT SETUP ===

CONTEXT:
I'm uploading an iOS app called "Trusenda CRM" to TestFlight for internal testing. I need you to create the app entry in Apple App Store Connect. I will log into the browser first.

Step 2: Create New App
- Click the blue "+" button (usually top-left near "My Apps")
- In the dropdown, select "New App"
- A form will appear

Step 3: Fill in ONLY These Required Fields
Platform:
- Check the checkbox for "iOS"
- Do NOT check any other platforms

Name:
- Enter exactly: TrusendaCRM
- (Note: This is just internal name for TestFlight, can change later)

Primary Language:
- Select: English (U.S.)

Bundle ID:
- This is a dropdown/search field
- Type: com.trusenda.crm
- Select it from the list (it should appear if already registered)
- If it says "Xcode iOS App" next to it, that's correct

User Access:
- Leave as: Full Access
- (Default is usually correct)

Step 4: Create the App
- Click the blue "Create" button at the bottom

- You should see "TrusendaCRM" appear in your apps list

Step 5: Verify Creation
- Confirm you're now on the app's page

- Click the "TestFlight" tab to confirm it's accessible

Step 6: Stop Here
- DO NOT fill in any other information
- DO NOT add screenshots
- DO NOT write descriptions
- DO NOT set pricing
- We only needed the app slot created

Confirmation: Tell me when the app is created and you're on the TestFlight tab.

IMPORTANT NOTES:
- If Bundle ID doesn't appear in dropdown, it needs to be registered first at developer.apple.com
- If app name is taken, try: "Trusenda - CRM" or "Trusenda Real Estate CRM"
- We're creating this for TestFlight testing ONLY, not public release yet

=== END PROMPT ===

NOTES FOR YOU:
- Copy everything above this line
- Give to AI agent after logging into appstoreconnect.apple.com
- Agent will create the app entry
- Then you come back to Xcode to upload the build
