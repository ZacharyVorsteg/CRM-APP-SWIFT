# Testing Guide - Status Update Fix

## Quick Test (2 minutes)

### Test 1: Basic Status Update
1. **Open the iOS app**
2. **Tap on any lead's status badge** (e.g., "Cold")
3. **Select a different status** (e.g., "Warm")

**✅ Expected Results:**
- Lead status changes instantly (you see "Warm" immediately)
- Lead stays visible in the list
- Success message appears at bottom: "Status updated to Warm"
- No errors

**❌ Old Behavior (Fixed):**
- Lead would disappear from list
- 404 error would appear
- Had to refresh to see leads again

### Test 2: Status Update with Filter Active
1. **Tap the filter icon** (top left)
2. **Select "Cold"** to show only Cold leads
3. **Tap a Cold lead's status badge**
4. **Change it to "Warm"**

**✅ Expected Results:**
- Lead changes to Warm instantly
- Lead stays visible (doesn't disappear)
- Filter remains active
- Success message appears

### Test 3: Network Error Simulation
1. **Enable Airplane Mode** (swipe down, tap airplane)
2. **Try to change a lead's status**

**✅ Expected Results:**
- Lead changes immediately (optimistic)
- After ~2-3 seconds, error appears
- Lead reverts back to original status
- Error message: "Request timed out. Please check your connection."
- Lead remains visible

3. **Disable Airplane Mode**
4. **Try the status change again**
5. **Should work normally**

## Detailed Test Scenarios

### Scenario A: Multiple Quick Updates
**Purpose:** Test that optimistic updates handle rapid changes

1. Change a lead from Cold → Warm
2. Immediately change it from Warm → Hot
3. Immediately change it from Hot → Closed

**✅ Expected:**
- Each change shows instantly
- No leads disappear
- Final state is "Closed"
- All updates succeed

### Scenario B: Update While Filtered
**Purpose:** Test filter persistence during updates

1. Apply status filter: "Warm"
2. You should see only Warm leads
3. Change a Warm lead to Hot
4. Lead disappears from filtered view (correct - it's no longer Warm)
5. Clear filter
6. Verify lead is now Hot in full list

**✅ Expected:**
- Filter behavior is intuitive
- No errors occur
- Lead is correctly updated

### Scenario C: Refresh After Update
**Purpose:** Verify server sync

1. Change a lead's status
2. Pull down to refresh (pull-to-refresh gesture)
3. Verify lead still has the new status

**✅ Expected:**
- Status persists after refresh
- Server and client are in sync
- No duplicate leads appear

### Scenario D: Update from Detail View
**Purpose:** Test updates from different screens

1. Tap on a lead to open detail view
2. Tap "Edit" button
3. Change the status field
4. Tap "Save"
5. Go back to lead list

**✅ Expected:**
- Status updates successfully
- Detail view closes
- Lead list shows new status
- No disappearing leads

## Debugging: If You See Errors

### Error: "Lead not found. Please refresh and try again."

**What it means:** The lead exists in your local app but not on the server.

**Why it happens:**
- Lead was deleted from another device
- You're testing with old test data
- Database was reset/cleared

**What the app does automatically:**
1. Shows the error message
2. Reverts the status change (rollback)
3. Automatically refreshes lead list
4. Syncs with server

**What you should do:**
- Pull to refresh manually if auto-refresh doesn't work
- If lead still appears, it's valid
- If lead disappears, it was deleted on server (correct behavior)

### Error: "Session expired. Please log in again."

**What it means:** Your authentication token expired.

**What to do:**
1. Log out of the app
2. Log back in
3. Try the operation again

### Error: "Request timed out. Please check your connection."

**What it means:** Network issue or server is slow.

**What to do:**
1. Check your internet connection
2. Try again
3. If persists, server may be having issues

## Verify Cloud Parity

The iOS app should match the cloud web app behavior exactly:

### Test Both Platforms:
1. **Open cloud web app** (https://trusenda.com)
2. **Open iOS app** side-by-side
3. **Change a lead's status on web**
4. **Refresh iOS app** (pull-to-refresh)
5. **Verify status matches**
6. **Change a lead's status on iOS**
7. **Refresh web app**
8. **Verify status matches**

**✅ Expected:**
- Both platforms show same data
- Status changes sync across platforms
- No conflicts or inconsistencies

## Performance Testing

### Test: UI Responsiveness
1. Open a list with 20+ leads
2. Rapidly tap different lead status badges
3. Change 5-10 statuses quickly

**✅ Expected:**
- UI never freezes
- Each change is instant
- No lag or stuttering
- All changes persist

### Test: Large Lead List
1. If you have 50+ leads, scroll to bottom
2. Change a lead's status near the bottom
3. Scroll back to top
4. Scroll back to bottom

**✅ Expected:**
- Lead is still visible
- Status is still updated
- No performance issues

## Edge Cases

### Edge Case 1: Same Status Update
1. Lead is "Warm"
2. Tap status badge
3. Select "Warm" again (same status)

**✅ Expected:**
- Nothing happens (no API call)
- No error message
- Lead stays as "Warm"

### Edge Case 2: Rapid Toggle
1. Change status Cold → Warm
2. Before API completes, change Warm → Cold
3. Before API completes, change Cold → Warm again

**✅ Expected:**
- Each optimistic update shows
- Final server state matches last selection
- No errors or crashes

### Edge Case 3: Concurrent Updates
1. Have iOS app open
2. Have web app open on same account
3. Update same lead on both at same time

**What happens:**
- Last update wins (server decides)
- iOS will show optimistic update
- On refresh, iOS will sync with server
- This is expected behavior

## Success Criteria

### All Tests Pass ✅ When:
- ✅ Status updates work instantly (optimistic)
- ✅ Leads never disappear unexpectedly
- ✅ Errors show helpful messages
- ✅ Network failures rollback gracefully
- ✅ Server sync works correctly
- ✅ Cloud parity maintained
- ✅ No crashes or freezes

## Reporting Issues

If you find a bug or unexpected behavior:

1. **Note the exact steps to reproduce**
2. **Check the Xcode console for error logs**
3. **Look for these key log messages:**
   ```
   🔄 Updating lead [id] from [old] to [new]
   ⚡️ Optimistic update applied to UI
   📥 Response received: [name] - [status]
   ❌ Update failed, rolling back optimistic changes...
   ```
4. **Share the console output**

### Key Log Patterns:

**Successful Update:**
```
🔄 Updating lead fe65d6bd... from Cold to Warm
⚡️ Optimistic update applied to UI
📤 PUT https://trusenda.com/.netlify/functions/customers/fe65d6bd...
📦 Body: { "status" : "Warm" }
🔐 Authorization header added
📥 Response received: John Doe - Warm
✅ Status updated successfully to Warm
```

**Failed Update with Rollback:**
```
🔄 Updating lead fe65d6bd... from Cold to Warm
⚡️ Optimistic update applied to UI
📤 PUT https://trusenda.com/.netlify/functions/customers/fe65d6bd...
⚠️ Client error 404: Customer not found
❌ Update failed, rolling back optimistic changes...
🔄 Rollback complete
Lead not found. Please refresh and try again.
```
