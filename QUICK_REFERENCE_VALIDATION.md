## 🔴 Red = Needs Attention

### Why a Field Might Stay Red:

**Property Title**
- You focused the field but didn't type
- You typed spaces only

**Address Search**
- You typed but didn't select from list
- You selected incomplete address
- ZIP code is not 5 digits

**Pickers (Type/Size/Price/Industry)**
- You opened picker but didn't select
- Still showing placeholder text
- Tag binding issue (rare)

**Photos**
- You opened picker but didn't select
- Photo still loading
- Load failed

## ✅ Green = All Good!

### What Triggers Green State:

**Property Title**
```swift
title.isEmpty ? RED : GREEN
```
→ Type any text

**Address Search**
```swift
!selectedAddressDisplay.isEmpty && isValidZipCode(zipCode) ? GREEN : RED
```
→ Select complete address from autocomplete

**Pickers**
```swift
propertyType.isEmpty ? RED : GREEN
```
→ Make selection from picker

**Photos**
```swift
loadedImages.isEmpty ? RED : GREEN
```
→ Successfully load at least 1 photo

## 🚨 Common Mistakes

### ❌ Wrong: Opening picker without selecting
```
User taps picker → Opens → Taps outside
Result: Still RED (no selection made)
```

### ✅ Right: Actually selecting value
```
User taps picker → Opens → Taps "Warehouse"
Result: GREEN (selection made)
```

### ❌ Wrong: Typing address manually
```
User types "123 Main St" in search box
Result: Still RED (no Google Places selection)
```

### ✅ Right: Selecting from autocomplete
```
User taps button → Types "123" → Selects from list
Result: GREEN (complete address auto-filled)
```
