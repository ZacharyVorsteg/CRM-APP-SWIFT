**1. Waiting for Review**
- Status: Yellow dot
- Time: 24-48 hours typically
- Your app is in queue

**2. In Review**
- Status: Orange dot
- Time: 2-24 hours

- Status: Green dot
- Your app is on the App Store! üéâ

**OR**

**Rejected**
- Status: Red dot
- Apple provides reasons
- You fix and resubmit

---

### Step 28: Common Rejection Reasons (and How to Avoid)

**1. Missing Privacy Policy**
- **Required:** Privacy policy URL
- **Fix:** Add privacy page to trusenda.com

**2. Inaccurate Screenshots**
- **Issue:** Screenshots don't match app
- **Fix:** Use real app screenshots (we will!)

**3. Crashes or Bugs**
- **Issue:** App crashes during review
- **Fix:** Test thoroughly before submitting

**4. Missing Features**
- **Issue:** Description promises features that don't exist
- **Fix:** Only describe what's actually there

**5. In-App Purchase Not Configured**
- **Issue:** Pro subscription mentioned but not set up
- **Fix:** Either remove Pro mention or configure IAP (I'll help)

---

## üí≥ PHASE 10: In-App Purchase Setup (Pro Subscription)

### Step 29: Create In-App Purchase (Optional but Recommended)

**Since you have Stripe, you have two options:**

**Option A: Keep Stripe (Easier for now)**
- Don't mention "Pro" or "subscription" in App Store listing
- Just say "Sign in with your Trusenda account"
- Users upgrade via web (which you already have)
- **Pros:** Works now, no changes needed
- **Cons:** Can't sell directly in app

**Option B: Add Apple In-App Purchase (Later)**
- Configure IAP in App Store Connect
- Add code to handle IAP in app
- Apple takes 30% (vs Stripe's 2.9%)
- **Pros:** Can sell in app
- **Cons:** More setup, higher fees

**My Recommendation:** Start with Option A (Stripe on web), add IAP later if needed.

---

## üìÑ PHASE 11: Required Legal Pages

### Step 30: Create Privacy Policy

**You MUST have this before submitting!**

**Quick Option - Privacy Policy Generator:**

1. **Go to:** https://www.privacypolicygenerator.info

   - App Name: Trusenda CRM
   - Website: trusenda.com
   - Email: zacharyvorsteg@gmail.com

### Step 31: App Preview Video (Optional)

**Not required for first submission**, but highly recommended:
