✅ FIXED - Info.plist added to Desktop version

CLOSE XCODE COMPLETELY, then:

1. Open Terminal
2. Run these commands:

cd "/Users/zachthomas/Desktop/CRM-APP-SWIFT"
rm -rf ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/TrusendaCRM-*

3. Open Xcode:

open TrusendaCRM.xcodeproj

4. In Xcode:
   - Product → Clean Build Folder (Cmd+Shift+K)
   - Product → Build (Cmd+B)
   - Product → Run (Cmd+R)

✅ Info.plist is now at: TrusendaCRM/Info.plist
✅ All 22 Swift files ready
✅ Should build successfully

The Info.plist error is fixed!
