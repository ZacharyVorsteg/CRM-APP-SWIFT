## 💡 Design Decisions

### Why Sequential Deletion?
**Decision:** Delete leads one-by-one vs batch API call

**Rationale:**
- ✅ Guarantees data integrity
- ✅ Proper server sync
- ✅ Better error handling
- ✅ Progress feedback possible
- ✅ Matches cloud implementation

**Trade-off:** Slightly slower for 50+ leads, but more reliable

### Why UserDefaults for Drafts?
**Decision:** UserDefaults vs Core Data vs Keychain

**Rationale:**
- ✅ Lightweight (~1KB per draft)
- ✅ Fast read/write
- ✅ Survives app termination
- ✅ Simple implementation
- ✅ No migration needed

**Trade-off:** Only supports one draft at a time (acceptable for v1)

### Why Auto-Exit Selection Mode?
**Decision:** Stay in mode vs exit after delete

**Rationale:**
- ✅ Prevents accidental deletes
- ✅ Clear completion signal
- ✅ Better UX flow
- ✅ Matches user expectation
