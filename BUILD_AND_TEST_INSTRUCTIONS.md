## ‚úÖ What Changed

### Single File Modified
`TrusendaCRM/Core/Utilities/DateFormatter+Extensions.swift`

**Change:**
```swift
// BEFORE
static func addingDays(_ days: Int) -> Date {
    let today = Date() // ‚ùå Used current time
    return calendar.date(byAdding: .day, value: days, to: today) ?? today
}

// AFTER
static func addingDays(_ days: Int) -> Date {
    let today = calendar.startOfDay(for: Date()) // ‚úÖ Uses midnight
    return calendar.date(byAdding: .day, value: days, to: today) ?? today
}
```

**Impact:**
- Fixes timezone edge cases when scheduling at night
- Ensures dates are always calculated from midnight
- Makes date logic match cloud app exactly

## üì± Device Testing

### Simulator Testing
- Fast and convenient
- Good for UI/UX testing
- Can test different iPhone models

### Physical Device Testing
- More accurate for performance
- Tests real network conditions
- Better for timezone testing
- Required for App Store submission

---

## üîÑ Cross-Platform Verification

### Test Sync Between iOS and Web

1. **Schedule on iOS:**
   - Create follow-up in iOS app
   - Note the date and task

2. **Check on Web:**
   - Open https://trusenda.com in browser
   - Login with same account
   - Find the lead
   - **Expected:** Follow-up appears with same date and notes

3. **Schedule on Web:**
   - Create follow-up in web app
   - Note the date and task

4. **Check on iOS:**
   - Pull to refresh in iOS app
   - Find the lead
   - **Expected:** Follow-up appears with same date and notes
