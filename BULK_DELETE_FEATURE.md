# Bulk Delete Feature - Implementation Summary

**Date:** October 17, 2025  
**Feature:** Multi-Select & Bulk Delete for Leads  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

---

## 🎯 Overview

Implemented enterprise-grade bulk selection and deletion for leads, addressing the critical use case of users downgrading from Pro to Free (requiring them to delete excess leads) while also providing convenient multi-delete for general cleanup.

### Business Problem Solved
1. **Plan Downgrade**: Users going from Pro (10,000 leads) to Free (10 leads) need to delete many leads
2. **Bulk Cleanup**: Users with 50+ leads need efficient way to delete multiple at once
3. **Accidental Additions**: Quick cleanup of test/duplicate leads
4. **Enterprise Feel**: Professional bulk operations like Salesforce/HubSpot
